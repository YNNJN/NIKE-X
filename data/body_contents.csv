"The story of the Nike x Tom Sachs Poncho is a reminder that good solutions take time to solidify. The product’s simplicity is deceiving. Its shapeshifting nature was perfected over the course of four years, dozens of prototypes, countless tests and innumerable hacks.The poncho began life in 2015 as one output of a design challenge to consider transforming apparel, and was undertaken by Jarrett Reynolds, Nike's senior design director for apparel special projects, and others. Reynolds was initially intrigued by the idea of a slimline pack complete with a quick-deploy poncho that pulled swiftly from its carry and could be easily repacked after use.""We used a tear-away zipper for the first incarnation. It allowed for the explosion — the forceful billowing that allowed the wearer to quickly get into the poncho — but it was really difficult to set up,"" says Reynolds.A collection of prototypes, including one made shortly after Sachs had an""ah-ha"" moment onDecember 24, 2017.Despite its finicky nature, this prototype led to eight or nine other concepts, over the course of two years, each helping show proof of concept but never quite clicking, so Reynolds shared the poncho via video to a frequent Nike collaborator, Tom Sachs.“He was like, ‘We've got to do something with this.’ I was stoked because Tom and his team are problem-solvers, they look at things from a different perspective than we do and that’s what we needed,” says Reynolds. From there, the project blossomed into a collaborative, inventive exercise with the artist. In conversation, Sachs discusses how the poncho went from speculative exercise to NIKECRAFTproject.Nike News: NIKECRAFTis a 50-50 enterprise between Nike and Tom Sachs. How does that work when it comes to this product? 
Tom Sachs: I want to start by reminding all of us that NIKECRAFTisn't just a brand, it's a philosophy and an approach to how we do stuff based on transparency and evidence of construction.Jarrett showed me the idea and expressed the problems with it — he said that it was too complicated. And I said, ‘No problem. We'll just make a movie about it.’ In doing that, we discovered it was as complicated as Jarrett suggested, so we began to work on different solutions.Through a lot of exploration and testing, the studio was able to find opportunity to push on an idea that had been stuck. We simplified the deploymentmechanism and the repacking mechanism. We integrated things like a drag-racing inspired parachute release mechanism, an extension flap to the ponchoand the fanny pack.NN: When someone shows you something like Jarrett had with the breakaway zippers and this vague construct, where does your mind go? How did you get to drag racing?
TS: When I saw his first prototype, I viewed it as a magic trick. Later, when I stumbled across the parachute release mechanism of a dragster and saw how it folded back, I saw how the problems that we were having with the complexity of the release mechanism were solved in other parts of industry. This particularmechanism, which allows a transition from fast to slow, served the purpose we needed. These transitions are reflected in the season of springtime, and March is the puberty of the seasons. And it's a very difficult month, statistically it’s when most people lose their cell phones and their keys and their walletbecause they're switching coats. Also, as you get caught in the rain during this time but rarely have a raincoat with you, I thought, why not combine all these problems? One thing that we’ve learned in the studio is that if you have a bunch of problems, sometimes adding more problems to the pile can start to solve the problems.NN: The collection also includes down shorts. Why do we need those?
TS: When I'm working in the studio — that's my athletic arena — when I wear shorts, I'm much more limber, I'm faster and I think better because I'm not constrained by fabric resistance in my knees.NN: All of the pieces also have ceramic embellishments produced by the Sachs studio. How do you think about your own studio as part of this multi-faceted manufacturing process?
TS: One of the greatest parts about working with Nike is being able to build things on a scale that the studio can never produce.I made some of these ceramic beads for other projects and I thought, well, they're pretty quick to make, and I thought, wouldn't it be great if we could make one small part of the final product,and make many thousands?We set up a little factory of beadmaking and we fired 16,000 of them that are hand formed, drilled, marked with a Swoosh and a Tom Sachs logo. And you can see the fingerprints of individuals who made them on the pieces.NN: Of course, other hands are involved in the process of making the pieces in the collection too. The poncho calls out Vietnam specifically. How important is the factory relationship with the collaboration of NIKECRAFT?
TS: The factory we worked with in Vietnam is, really, one the best makers that I've worked with at Nike. They didn't just blindly do what they were told. And that's a true measure of a real collaboration. Together, we all workedto produce the product, and in the spirit of transparency, I think it's really worth talking about the individuals who make the things.Channeling all this into a finished NIKECRAFTproduct requires a healthy push-pull. Transparency is critical, as is sharing the underpinnings of how things work. The ingenuity of the thinking is solidified with a NIKECRAFTfirst: The poncho’s mechanics are patent pending.The poncho, which is the highlight of the NIKECRAFTTransitions collection (inclusive of the Mars Yard Overshoe and the previously mentioned down short), incorporates materials ranging from Dyneema®️ (the same super-strong fiber used on the Mars Yard Overshoe) for the trinity case behind the poncho, to those ceramic beads created by Sachs’studio. A Fidlock buckle ensures ease of use for the waist strap, and the poncho itself was prepared from a three-layer waterproof and breathable fabric that allowed for minimal size with maximum coverage. Bold printing on the back of the garment proudly announces the location of manufacture: Vietnam.“The ideas in this collection — transparency of materials and of construction — are very well reflected, and I'm really honored by this body of work. They have the same value and integrity of the sculptures that I make in the studio,” says Sachs.And, while the products certainly could be displayed, Sachs believes strongly that they should not only be used, but also serve as an impetus to dig in and learn more. More about doing, about imagining and, above all, about process.The apparel elements of the NIKECRAFTTransitions collection launchApril 27 in Japanto coincide with Sachs' ""Tea Ceremony"" exhibition at Tokyo Opera City ArtGallery. A global release will follow.Update February 8, 2020:Apparel fromthe NIKECRAFT Transitions collection is available globallyFebruary 15.

"The latest Nike x Pigalle CollectionSince 2014, Nike has worked with Parisian Stéphane Ashpool’s Pigalle in a mutual celebration of basketball’s pure cultural impact. The collaboration has generateda series of apparel and footwear collections, andalso focused on supporting community-building programming by providing safe harbor for players.In September 2019, an initial courtin Parisbecame a hub for the city's players and an international symbol for the game's creative impulses. In2019, Ashpool and Nike aim to bring the Pigalle perspective on safe sport spaces to new cities.The Nike x Pigalle basketball court in Beijing""Our court in Paris birthed a community,"" says Ashpool. ""We transformed a parking lot into a place that has fostered a family and inspired people. All the subtle details that can make this magic happen wereunited. It was the best learning for me, and now it’s the right time to work in expanding this scheme, staying organic, authentic and focused.""A second Pigalle court also opened in Beijing, China in fall 2019. The location is testament to China's fervor for basketball, andthe need to provide a place that can become part of the community fabric. ""The importance of the project is to give players the best outdoor facilities in order to make them comfortable enough to create something bigger,"" Ashpool says. ""We want the court to become a second home. That’s how you build a community organically around a space —we simply give them the right tools.""The court and surrounding space, covering an area of 600 square meters, wascreated with NIKE GRIND, amounting toa total of 45,000 pairs of recycled sports shoes. Throughout the year, the courtwill host a series of exclusive opportunities for female players — including organized activity through the city's high school basketball league and adjacent community groups.

"The Converse x GOLF le FLEUR* GiannoFor the past few years, Tyler, The Creatorhas been steadily building with Converse. His exploration of the brand’s classics, the One Star and the Chuck 70, have allowed for experiments in color, fit, material and proportion. His latest output, the GOLF le FLEUR* Gianno, pushes the lessons learned to new boundaries. The Gianno is a new concept, engineered from the ground up, and, as should be in a true signature shoe, it is distinctly Tyler, The Creator.""This was an opportunity to create a build that he could have ownership and creative input to,"" says Matt Sleep, Converse’s Footwear Design Director. ""We worked to craft a design language for Tyler with nods to Converse DNA and heritage. The intent was to create something thatfelt contemporary and fresh, but maybe not necessarily something that looked outwardly 'Converse' at first sight.""Synthesizing these considerations and some of Tyler's starting points — such as influences from outdoor footwear, running and basketball — results in something unconventionally multidimensional. While there are outdoor vibes, it isn't immediately a hiking shoe. And, while the midsole drafts off the ERX series, the basketball DNA is suppressedeven if it comes across more overtly elsewhere.Equipped with a midfoot shank, the shoe is stable. The tread pattern is rugged and its nod to Converse's ’90s basketball archive is another surprise crossover element. ""The shoe is a combination of style and function,"" says Amy Rauner, Senior Footwear Designer at Converse. ""The multidirectional non-skid, lugged outsole should work in many different conditions —whether it be biking on BMX trails or hiking in the woods.""The mix of leather, nylon and suede gives the upper a rich dimensionality, while the various color choices allow Tyler to investigate both retro and contemporary influences, from current runway culture to the lineage oftrail running. The sculpted, fitted upper hosts detailing, such as themini debossed fleur motif, and reflective eye rows that weave through the design. These detailsprovideintriguing depth to the sneaker from all angles.The Gianno outsoleThe Converse x GOLF le FLEUR* Gianno launches exclusively at Camp Flog Gnaw, with a global release November 11 onconverse.com and Golf Wang Stores.

It was defined by a subtle upper color scheme, accented by pops of color on the tongue and midsole — a characteristic that remains in its 2020 version.

Even more enticing than its lightweight feel was its ability to stand out on the pitch: the cleat’s vibrant orange pop of color from the tongue, heel graphic, stud tips and laces created a stark contrast from the black premium leather upper (a signature of the Tiempo franchise). Nike Flywire technology was integrated into the leather for a midfoot lockdown and, overall, more dynamic fit, while enhanced vamp stitching was strategically placed for lateral agility.With tribute to itspredecessor, the latest Nike Tiempo Legend 8 gets OG Tiempo Legend IV Elite color treatment.Its fit and feel is defined by the Legend 8’s stitchless, quilted diamond pattern upper and Flyknit Fit Tunnel, providing a supportive and snug fit around the midfoot.Additionally, the boot has Quadfit mesh in the forefoot to prevent overstretch of theouter leather layer.The boot is the fourth and final release fromNike Football’sFuture DNA Pack, in which Nike’s current performance boots each pay homage to a classic Nike Football design, and follows the release of theNike Phantom VSN 2 Future DNA Hypervenom, theNike Mercurial Vapor Future DNA Mercurialand theNike Phantom VNM Future DNA T90.The NikeTiempoFuture DNATiempo Legendis available March 27 on nike.com.March 20, 2020 - The Nike Phantom VNM Future DNA T90brings classic Nike Football design to one of the brand’s latest on-pitchinnovations.Originally released in 2002, the Nike Air Zoom Total 90 IIwas the perfect blend of comfort, power and precision.

"Kim maintains the original 1991 Mowabb design with modern updates that emphasize the footwear's dual personalities.A cult classic since its launch in 1996, the side-laced Footscape is spiced upwith pink and zebra print.The Air Max 98 borrows from the iconoclastic Air Max 120 and is paired with red, green and yellow accents to create a sense of vibrant street elegance.Inspired by the silhouette's Black Cat nickname, the Air Jordan IV features the original Nike Air logo and blends on-court details with fashion-forward materials.A global street culture standard, the Air Force 1 has served as a canvas for aritsts and designers; Kim's take adaptsthe 1996 ivory snakeskin design for her Swoosh logo.Olivia Kim, Vice President, Creative Projects at Nordstrom, delivers fresh takes on five Nike, Inc. footwearcanvases including the Nike Air Force 1, Air Mowabb, Air Footscape, Air Max 98 and Air Jordan IV, along with 16 apparel and accessory pieces for her latest Nike by Olivia Kim Collection.The assembled pieces forma perfect confluence of classic Nike andJordan designs and Olivia’s style — which is rooted in the rave and hip-hop styles defining ‘90s New York.

"The Fall 2019 Nike Gyakusou CollectionIf one considers GYAKUSOU a club — the GYAKUSOU International Running Association (GIRA) — its constituents are those who value running for its intangible benefit: finding elusive peace. For fall 2019, Jun Takahashi gave this value a physical incarnation by pulling graphic inspiration for the latest GYAKUSOU collection from the boldrebel spirit of the 1970s running revolution. This was the decade that running emerged as a pursuit disconnected from competition, and the enduring energy of the time has become a rallying point for successive generations of runners.While Takahashi typically tackles urban running, thisGYAKUSOU output considers the trail. At centeris the Nike Air Zoom Pegasus 36 Trail, a crossover trainer that offers easy transition from trail to road. Surrounding the shoe is a six-piece apparel assortment that includes a rain top with zip-off hood, long-sleeve top, two short-sleeve tops, shorts and a multi-functional pant. As expected, Takahashi employs cutting-edge performance fabricsfor each piece, and adds to articulated storage solutions.The Fall 2019 Nike Gyakusou CollectionThe Fall 2019 Nike Gyakusou CollectionThe Fall 2019 Nike Gyakusou CollectionThe Fall 2019 Nike Gyakusou CollectionThe duality of the Peg Trail shoe is captured by its two color schemes: one a classic red, white and blue expression and the other in Takahashi's now familiar mix of earthy tones. Additionally, Takahashi has placed a rose on the Peg Trail — the flower's beautiful petals and sharp thorns emblematic of the designer's balance/chaos ethos. Running, naturally, brings Takahashi balance, and in its freedom, he's able to dream up new ideas. The intent with GIRA is that it provides fuel for others to do the same.The Nike Air Zoom Pegasus 36 TrailThe Nike Air Zoom Pegasus 36 TrailFast Facts on the Nike Air Zoom Pegasus 36 Trail:1. The shapes and placements of the upper components have been informed by heat-mapping research.2. The shoe has overlays placed in areas where trail runners need support and reinforcement, and also leaves as open as possible areas of the foot that show a higher temperature.3. The lacing system, made with a strong, lightweight cable, is asymmetric to be more inline with the actual anatomy of the foot’s toe bones.4. The upper’s mesh is treated with a water-repellent coating, and is made from material that allows a quick-dry and water drainage.The Fall 2019 Nike GYAKUSOUcollection drops September 26."

The 11-piece collection combines the past and present of Nike’s running apparel innovations through a tour de force of strikingly-contrasted logos, patterns, colors and hemlines.The output channels Abe’s signature design language, whichbrings a new irreverence to running style and extends a partnership with Nike that began in 2014. ""sacai was just at the beginning of its foray into the international realm,” says Fraser Cooke, Special Projects Senior Director. “We saw immediately that Abe is very good at mixing up sportswear with high fashion. One of the things that we thought was really interesting about working with sacai was her way of layering and draping.”Belief in Abe’s work with sportswear and military icons has rung true.The Nike x sacai skirt is ispired by the styling of a jacket, likethe Nike Windrunner, tied around the waist.“Often, I take the things I like from two different items of clothing and splice them together to create a whole that is bigger than the sum of its parts,"" explains Abe.""I express the end result as a ‘hybrid.'""Her capacity to deconstruct and reconstruct ideas — a hallmark of sacai — gives an unmistakable character to the current collaborative effort. The process also allows for a twofold hybridization. The first is a melding of ideas, the second in true balance of activity.“There has to be a genuine interest or connection in order for me to create something new and unexpected,"" says Abe.""Another important thing is that the partnership needs to contribute exactly half the work.""Sky Brownwearing theNike x sacai fall 2019 apparel collection and BlazerA firm appreciation for Nike’s history and heritage comes through in Abe’s reimagining of running garments. She transforms the storied Windrunner into a skirt, grants an irreverence to the usually mundane half-zip and adds a refined edge to the classic Tiempo short. Her longstanding virtuosity in layering and draping is on full display.Nike’s mastery in shoe design is clear in making Abe’s imagined footwear fusion tangible. “We literally got two photocopied pictures of two different shoes that they folded in half and put on top of each other,” says Cooke of the beginning stages of the Nike x sacai LDWaffle.The resulting sneaker, a sterling example of equal contribution, certainly creates an entity greater than a simple mash-up of its components. It is symbolic of the Nike x sacai running collection as a whole — rethinking the relationship between craft, material and symbol with aplomb.The Nike x sacai apparel drops in September alongside new colorways of the LDWaffle and Blazer."

"Multidisciplinary Dutch artist Piet Parra has always skated in white shoes. Fans of his art, and the many Nike sneakers he's played a role in creating, have come to expect bold bursts of color and pattern. The challengein formulating an approach for his first capsule collection with Nike SB was balancing his identity as a skater with expectations of his output.""I knew I wanted to make a shoe that I would skate in, but also appeal to the people that are more into my use of color and drawings,"" he says. ""That’s how I got to the colorful, layered Swoosh and the crazy pattern on the inside of the shoe.""The multi-colored, layered Swoosh, which finishes in a pink chenille, embellishes both a Dunk and Blazer, giving each a unique textural dimension. A pattern built from the Swoosh execution, along with typography and characters developed by Parra, decorate the shoes' respective insoles and inform the design of the collections' apparel pieces —including caps, T-shirts, polos and trousers.The Nike SB x Parra Collection releases July 26 at skate shops andJuly 27 on SNKRS and SNEAKRS.

"Since making its unforgettable first impression in 1998, the Nike Mercurial has had an unbreakable history-making lineage.That lineage is injected with a certain magic. Few football boot lines blend a legacy of innovation and on-field brilliance like the Mercurial.It also helps that it has become an athlete favorite. In fact, the 2018 Mercurial 360 is one of the most beloved Nike boots of all time. Of the hundreds of professional players wearing the boot, only fivein the world have opted to have their Mercurials modified in any capacity. When asked to rate the boot on a scale of 1 to 10, professional players overwhelmingly rank it as a10. The lowest score? Onelonely 8.For a design team that starts every project by listening to the voice of the athlete, that 8 serves as a challenge. The 2019 Mercurial breaks the previous two-year cycle of innovation upgrades, working to make the bootbetter on a faster timeline than ever before.The result is a Mercurialwith improvements over its predecessor in upper and plate technologies, as well as an upgraded graphic language.The structure of the knit upper of the 2019 Mercurial is more open than that of the 2018 version. This lessens any stiffness of the material, making it softer and more comfortable. High tenacity yarns, which are an elevated version of Nike Flywire, are then integrated into the structure for lockdown from heel to forefoot. These high tenacity yarns keep the boot from stretching out and make the 2019 Mercurial upper Nike Football’s strongest Flyknit offering to date. The upper constructionalso marks the first time Flywire and Flyknit have been melded into one, which adds to a history of firsts in the Mercurial line.The addition of All Conditions Control (ACC) prevents the bootfrom being porous.Taking inspiration from speed cycling shoes that clip into pedals, the new Nike Aerotrak plate serves as the power transfer area. In conjunction with the revamped internal chassis, Nike's Aerotrak plate delivers more snap than its predecessor. It is intentionally minimalist, leaving only what is truly needed — and shaving weight off the boot in the process. The2019 Mercurial 360 comes in under 200 grams.Take a look at thedrop Swoosh on the boot's lateral side. The logodips down to the stud and continues underfoot — something that can only be done with a Flyknit 360 upper construction.In addition,Nike’s iconic “Just Do It” slogan and the boot’s nickname, “Merc,” are added tothe heel counter.“Nike Football”appears ina spectrum of languages across the plate. Consistent with the boot’s theme of lightweight speed, the lateral Swoosh has been left hollow and open-ended on the tail.Made in Italy, the 2019 Mercurial 360 Vapor/Superfly will debut inBlue Fury and Black colorways. It will be available July 7 on nike.com."

"Nike collaboratorsAhn, Kocher, Mageeand Serre.In sport, the jersey is a garment that at once supports and celebrates brilliant performance.For athletes, it serves a utilitarian purpose — the jersey is a tool for their crazy dream. For the fans, the jersey serves to support their favored team and, ultimately, their community.As the world readies for play in France this summer, Yoon Ahn, Christelle Kocher, Erin Magee and Marine Serre transform the jersey in their vision, proving that while a jersey need not take a standard form, it can become a standard reminder of the unifying power of sport.Each designer has also matched a bra with their jersey. Here they describe the intent behind their respective concepts:Yoon Ahn’s Nike x AMBUSH® jersey shines a spotlight on the diversity and culture that is celebrated on the international tournament stage.My Nike x AMBUSH® jersey is a unisex hybrid football jersey inspired by the Happi coat, a traditional Japanese straight-sleeved coat. I chose the Happi coat because, although we are celebrating the tournament and the incredible female players, I believe it is just as important for the fans, for everyone to have a universal piece to celebrate in.The Nike x Koché jersey explores fabric, color and cut to produce an elegant asymmetry.The idea was to give the feeling of movement and positive energy. I created this dress by reconstructing the soccer jersey around the female body. The result is a dress that can be worn by a girl who plays, dances or moves in the city.Magee celebrates the ground-breaking U.S.Women’s National teams of the late ‘90s with a match-ready Nike Stadium jersey featuring the USA federation crest.I wanted this jersey to be sport first, fashion second. It’s meant to celebrate the incredible victorious history of the USWNT by drawing attention to the woman namesake of the iconic sportswear company itself: Nike the Goddess of Victory.Serre presents a slender, articulated jersey designed to be worn over a printed body suit.The focus of my designs is always hybridity and adapting to daily life. It’s important to create a purposeful line that makes a female feel good without compromising the style."
"The second collaborative capsule from Converse and TakahiroMiyashita TheSoloist. takes inspiration from the storied Jack Purcell, which originally released in 1933 and, despite its smiley face bumper, has a bit of a rebellious streak.The sneakers's dual character — part sport classic, part cultural classic — is conveyed by Takahiro Miyashita's employment of a mismatched ‘Stars and Bars’ graphic canvas (a print originally introduced by Converse in 1991) and a vertical utility zipper framed by asymmetrical lacing. It is an appropriately respectful yet defiant approach to transforming the silhouette, fully in keeping with Takahiro's ingenuity.The TakahiroMiyashita TheSoloist. founder riffs on vintage Americana to unpack the nuanced style directives of the silhouette. A lightweightGORE-TEX®jacket, short-sleeve T-shirt and hoodie feature stylized zips, eyelets and lacing reminiscent of the Jack Purcell, while each host hidden discovery elements that allow for packable transformation or utilitarian styling.The Converse x TakahiroMiyashita TheSoloist. capsule launches May 23 at Converse.com.To download hi-res images, click here."
"The best collaborations stem from unabashed passion. This is true of the Patta x Jordan collection,inclusive of the Air Jordan VII “Patta,” a track suit, shorts, T-shirt and bucket hat,which marks the first time Jordan Brand has partnered with a European brand. TEAM PATTA uses the relationship as a conduit for relaying personal nostalgia about the Jordan VII and the early '90s to their current audience.For Patta’s Guillaume Schmidtand Vincent van de Waal, the Jordan VII was the logical starting point for working with Jordan Brand.Launched in ’92, and subsequently eternally tied to that summer’s USA Basketball team, the Jordan VII arrived at a transformative point in both men’s youth and their respective interest in the culture they live and work within.“It was a golden era for hip-hop. It was a big time for me, a lot of very important albums that I carry with me still came out between '92 and '96. And aesthetically, those years had such strong, colorful and connected relationship to black empowerment. The VII also has a reference to Africa,” says Guillaume, a native of Suriname who grew up an hour from Amsterdam in basketball-crazed's Hertogenbosch.Vincent, Patta’s creative director, was drawn to the Jordan VII’s elegant shape and the minimal marking (it wasthe first in theJordan line without any Nike branding). Today, Vincentis effusive about the shoe, stating, “It is my all-time favorite.”The footwear itself plays only part of the story, as both Guillaume and Vincent recognized immediately the power of the full package surrounding the VII. “The VII apparel was out of this world. The products that we worked on come straight from a short Jordan clip from Barcelona that became super famous.It features a segment where Michael walks past a huge billboard of himself where he'sgot the shoes on, and that image has been forever etched in my memory,” says Guillaume.Reviving the pattern of those original garments, Patta is also able to tie in its branding subtly though incorporation of “TEAM PATTA” word marks. “We see ourselves as a strong team where everybody has theirplace, so the concept of ‘TEAM PATTA’ has always been important to our history,” says Vincent.The Patta x Jordan Collection releases May 18 at Patta’s Amsterdam and London locations, as well as on patta.nl. It will launch June 15 on the SNKRS and SNKEAKRS appand at select retailers."
"Nike x UNDERCOVER SU19 CollectionFor almost a decade, Jun Takahashi has worked with Nike on the running-focused Gyakusou line, which takesinspiration from his own sporting interest andprobesthe interplay of fluid movement, fixed environment and the meditative value of running. Beginning this summer, Takahashi extends his relationship with Nike by way of a formal collaboration with his brand, UNDERCOVER.“With Nike, we are able to explore technical materials and fabrications that allow for new investigations of UNDERCOVER's design principles,” says Takahashi.With the debut of Nike x UNDERCOVER, Takahashi challenges two things: static volume and utility norms.Each of the four garments in the collection allows for adjustments to fit via Velcro tabs. For example, the long-sleeve top can be modified for width, while the T-shirt allows for fine-tuning of the arm holes. This creates opportunities to personalize drape and scale, alternately loose and oversized or streamlined.Takahashi’s bold approach to carrying personal essentials gives each garment a distinct functional value. Most radically, the hood of the tracksuit functions as a pocket and the body has zippered mesh pockets at the back to complement the more traditional kangaroo front pocket. The tracksuit’s trouser has both cargo pockets and a zippered mesh pouch at the rear. Both long-sleeve top and T-shirt also incorporate mesh.Subtle “CHAOS BALANCE” text, a longstanding UNDERCOVER motif, embellish each garment and signify the brand’s philosophy of marrying raw energy and technical expertise.The Nike x UNDERCOVER DaybreakDebuted during UNDERCOVERS's spring/summer 2019 Paris runway show, Takashi's examination of the Nike Daybreak completes the assortment. The shoewill release in seven colorways.Global release of the inauguralNike x UNDERCOVER collection begins June 7."

"Nike x CPFM VaporMax 19Debuted on Air Max Day, the Nike x Cactus Plant Flea Market VaporMax 2019 reimagines the future-forward silhouette with a deft balance of its inherent technicality and CPFM's two-fold design intent.First, by introducing 3D puff lettering, stitched taping, mismatched coloring and a wobbly Swoosh (formed by garden wiring), the VaporMax takes a hand-made feel. This human quality connects to the second intent: highlighting the natural beauty of “in-between time,” the moments in dawn and dusk that define a city’s particular color field. This concept, specifically the optical phenomenon of a green flash — a sliver of green that appears upon the crest of the sun as it merges with the horizon — inspired the color choices.Nike x CPFM VaporMax 19Nike x CPFM VaporMax 19Nike x CPFM VaporMax 19Nike x CPFM VaporMax 19Nike x CPFM VaporMax 19The Nike x CPFM VaporMax 2019 releases globallyon May 14 on the SNKRS and SNEAKRS apps, and at select NikeLab retail locations worldwide."

The Travis Scott Air Jordan I High OG achieves his goal with details like a backwardNike Swoosh, hidden heel pocket and subtle Cactus Jack branding — along with a touch of childhood memory.""These Jordan 1s are just a fresher version of my old play shoes,” says Scott.“The colors are from tones and textures of what I saw growing up and remind me of my backyard and playing outside.""To create the collar pocket, an AJI sample was dissected to determine which area would be most practical. When the lining was cut, it was discovered that the collar created a natural pocket that could be sealed with a Velcro enclosing.Scott’s individual touches extend to the minimal Cactus Jack branding, which is employed so as not to overpower the minimal design of the shoe. These understated elements come viathe embossed heel, tongue patchand an inner mid-panel that all feature Scott’s hand-sketched logos.Scott’s debut apparel collection with Jordan Brand complements the Air Jordan I.

"NikeAir Fear of God RaidJerry Lorenzo saw the Nike Air Raid for the first time as a high school sophomore when a fellow student came into class withit on. The shoe itself was an immediate object of desire. Lorenzo loved the gray and black color scheme, he said, and the nuances of the geometric patterns and the impact of the crossed straps. He noted there was a positive, pro-Black feeling about it. It was the first Nike shoe outside of Jordan he had an emotional connection to.""When the kid walked in the classroom with the Air Raid, no one told me that I was supposed to like the Air Raid. I was just drawn to it, the design, the colors. It was like, oh my God, what is that?"" Lorenzo recalls. ""It became interconnected with all these other real emotional things that were happening at the time of the shoe.""As he learned more about sneaker culture, Lorenzodiscovered that the Raid was designed for playground use. It wasn’t strictly off-court, instead it was an early channeling of basketball culture into a physical manifestation. The Raid was a vibe — sport and spirit in fashionable unison.Here’s where sport and style carry a different groove though: Lorenzo’s most memorable collegiate sporting experience doesn’t come from play but from a halftime show.1998, six years after the Air Raid released but still within the time frame of the cultural epoch it was birthed in, Lorenzo was at FloridaAgricultural and Mechanical University (FAMU), his alma matter, for homecoming. The traditional half-time battle of the bands struck off with the opposition re-purposing a Miami bass banger.""Everyone went crazy, and we were just so demoralized. We were just like, what are we going to do? How can we top that?"" he remembers.FAMU's band comes on and throws a curveball. It didn't play a current hit. Nor did it pull in a prior fan favorite. Instead, the band ripped into the horn section from a deep cut of an Atlanta duo’s recently released third album. The stadium exploded. The visceral energy of sport in action — a common language utilized as an ignition point. It was a reminder that the experience of sport is multifaceted.""It was the emotion of that feeling, the soul of that feeling — watching the stadium being rocked side to side that serves as a measuring stick of what I'm trying to do emotionally every time through product,"" says Lorenzo.Nike Air Fear of God reversible jersey,Nike Air Fear of God woven pant,Nike Air Fear of God Raid worn by WNBA player Diamond DeShields of the Chicago SkyAs the lead element of the second Nike AirFear of God release, the Nike Air Fear of God Raid, extends the notion of spirit from the court to the larger cultural milieu around the game. It reminds that the aural and the visual are equally important in defining the tenor of time.Because of that the Nike Air Raid is a perfect conduit for Lorenzo's design construct. Giving it new shape and new life doesn't recreate the past, it gives the present time an object of its own to with which to shepard the tone of this time.Nike Air Fear of God SPSU19 CollectionNike Air Fear of God warm-up pant,Nike Air Fear of God RaidNike Air Fear of God parka,Nike Air Fear of God hoodieNike Air Fear of God long-sleevehenley, Nike Air Fear of God reversible jersey,Nike Air Fear of God woven pant,Nike Air Fear of God Raid (F&F colorway)Nike Air Fear of God warm-up top,Nike Air Fear of God all-over print woven pant,Nike Air Fear of God RaidNike Air Fear of God warm-up top,Nike Air Fear of God warm-up pant,Nike Air Fear of God RaidThe second drop of Nike AirFear of God follows Lorenzo's desire to honor Nike's historically strong design language through modern shape and proportion.

"The legacy of Air may be sustained by Nike’s robust internal collaboration, but its vibrancy is supported by cross-pollinating ideas with a variety of global talents. In sneaker terms, this equates to the “x” in Nike’s creative partnerships. The resulting products have yielded radical reconsiderations, far-out articulations and some of the most sought-after visions of Air ever.

The latest of these come from a quartet of intriguing and ambitious Air Max designs from Tokyo-based Atmos, Edison Chen's venerable CLOT, New York's Heron Preston and the elusive Cactus Plant Flea Market. Each offers a distinct take on an Air Max classic with a different starting point — remixed, recreated, re-tooledand re-imagined, respectively.The Nike x Atmos Air Max 2 Lightremixes a mid-90s design with a a full-blown, all-over print aesthetic. It will be released globally on April 5.The Nike x Clot Air Max 97/Haven melds the upper of the cult-classic Nike Zoom Haven (introduced in 2000 and, incidentally, a platform for an early fashion collaboration) with the Air Max 97 tooling. In this, CLOT recreates Air Max in an all-new articulation. The shoe's global release comes May 8.The Nike Air Max 720/95 Heron Preston By You marries the Air Max 720and Air Max 95 whilehighlighting the Air-Solewithan Air-wrapped upper. The shoe is available for customizationbeginning April 15.The Nike x CPFM Air VaporMax 2019 reimagines the VaporMax aesthetic with unique upper embellishments that convey a Just Do It attitude. It drops May 14 exclusively at Dover Street Market locations."
"Harlem-born A$AP Nasthas developed his singular aesthetic through an expressive bend of fashion concepts and hip-hop style.Nastworked with Converse footwear designers Julian Guzman andMatt Sleep to give the Jack a utilitarian vibe appropriately honoring his love for the outdoors. This is achieved through a heightening of the shoe's rubber overlays, which addsdimension and durability to the heritage canvas upper.“The silhouette is functional, durable. It’s intriguing. I wanted to craft a style that could be worn every day,” says Nast.Very rarely does a shoetranscend generationsthe way theJack Purcell has done. Released as a badminton shoe in 1933, it gained a second life as a lifestyleshoe in the mid-60s and has since become a bonafidecasual classic.""At the time of its introduction, the Jack Purcell had tremendous impactbut limited reach given its positioning as a badminton sneaker,” notes Jimmy Manley, Senior Director ofSpecial Projects at Converse. “Because it has since crossed over to the lifestyle space,its reach todayis much broader.The silhouetteis sure to experience yet another cultural refresh, thanks to Nast’s influence with a diverse range of youthful consumers.”The Converse x A$AP Nast collection also includes two Crew Sweatshirts, matching Crew Sweatpantsand a set of vintage wordmark T-shirts thatfeature a printed “JP” graphic (short for Jack Purcell) on the front panel, and words Nast considers integral to Converse’s place in culture listed on the back panel.The apparel and the shoesreleaseMarch 22.View the full collection here."
"Mr. Link in the Missing Link x Nike Air Max SusanMr. Link, the protagonist of LAIKA's new film, ""Missing Link,"" is the inspiration behind the latest collaboration between Nike and the animation studio. In the story,Mr. Link, a lovable creature, supportsSir Lionel Frost, the world's greatest monster chaser, on a globetrotting adventure to find a remnant of Mr. Link’s primitive ancestry. The Missing Link x Nike Air Max Susan, designed by Nike VP of Advanced Concepts, Tinker Hatfield, and former animator Michael Berger, translates the materials and textures of Mr. Link's plaid suit, created by LAIKA costume designer Deborah Cook, to a Nike Air Max 1.""Costume isn't a separate entity from character design, it's very much intrinsic,"" says Deborah Cook. ""If Mr. Link was wearing completely different clothes, you'd read him in a very, very different way.""Cook explains that Mr. Link's aesthetic plays up the character's Pacific Northwest roots and balances it with a desire to serve as playful foil to the urbane Frost. This is also evident in the shoe's leather-wrapped midsole, cuff links and kurim fur tufts on the tongue that lend a gleefully haphazard elegance to the silhouette.Missing Link x Nike Air Max SusanMissing Link x Nike Air Max SusanMissing Link x Nike Air Max SusanMissing Link x Nike Air Max SusanProduction of the Missing Link x Nike Air Max Susan and its unique elements benefit from a blend of LAIKA's specialty in 3D printing (the company was awarded a Scientific and Engineering Oscar® plaque for its innovation in 3D printing in 2016) and Nike's rapid prototyping.The team also used LAIKA's Stratasys PolyJet-based 3D printing solutions to create an exclusive pair of theMissing Link x Nike Air MaxSusanfor Mr. Link.""The Air Max 1 has always been a really uplifting, happy design. When I saw the film, I immediately felt Mr. Link was instantly lovable — he's happy-go-lucky, the type to stop and smell the flowers. So, he's got a certain chill that for me made sense with the silhouette,"" says Hatfield.Nike has a long-time partnership with the LAIKA studio, and while many shoes have been produced in tandem over the years, the Missing LinkxNike Air Max Susan is the first to release commercially.The Missing Link x Nike Air Max Susan releasesApril 9. Missing Link arrives in theatersApril 12."
"Shanghai streetwear boutiqueDOE, takes its name from the moniker for the anonymous or unknown person: John Doe. Celebrating its 5th anniversary, Converse's collaboration with DOE connects the name with the traditional Eastern philosophy ""empty your mind, be formless.""""I wanted to celebrate our 5-year anniversary of the shop by reflecting DOE’s attitude into the design details for the Chuck 70 and Jack Purcell. In Western culture, DOE identifies as anyone and everyone, which is echoed in our choice of the silhouettes, which are worn and loved by so many across China,” says Terry Zhu, co-founder of DOE.The capsule collection is highlighted by the Chuck 70 and Jack Purcell, both of rich carry cubed graphics, inspired by ""suprematism,"" a challenge to traditional figurative art, and prepared in an engineered jacquard knit.

"Tyler, The Creator's latest Converse x GOLF le FLEUR* collection offers a nod to'60s American workwear through a unisex cotton boiler suit. Complete with a contrast collar, elastic waistband, embroidered pockets and minimalist back panelGOLF leFLEUR* branding, the garment is decidedly defiant. Tyler's intent is to allow the genderless garment to serve as a foundational piece — one that can be styled with a high degree of personalization.“With Tyler's twist, the suit balances vintage and modern vibes.

"Some people run fast. Others run far. Some do both. Some run races — against time, another person or even the mind. Many cherish solo moments on the open road while just as many prefer to share the experience with fellow harriers. Running can energize; but it can calm, too.For UNDERCOVER founder Jun Takahashi, running is a source of creativity — a meditative exercise that allows him to contemplate ideas for his next collection and visualize them.With his Gyakusou collections, now almost 10 years deep, Takahashi's intent is to blend high-performance wear with the urban landscape. This forms, in some respect, a symbiosis between fluid movement and static environment, a desire held for all of his output.""I intentionally include earthy colors. It is important to bring together my aesthetics with Nike’s functionality,"" he notes.​​Gyakusou SP19 continues to pair Takahashi's style with Nike's latest running apparel advances. This includes garments designed for packability, as well as those formed through body-map engineering to ensure sharpest functionality.The Transform JKT, as the name suggests, “transforms” the jacket by unzipping the front and stuffing the top part of the jacket into its pocket. The Gyakusou version of the jacket gives the lightweight woven outerthatprotects runnersfrom wind and raina distinct color and graphic treatment, while the soft Dri-Fit base is designed to wick sweat. A second jacket, the Lightweight JKT, employs skin temperature maps to ensure properly placed laser cut holes to maximize breathability.

"Matthew Williams, founder of 1017 ALYX 9SM, says he is fascinated by opportunities afforded by Nike's varied suite of digital design tools. His collections embody his belief that the intersection of human imagination and technology points to an exciting future. Of course, he knows that data alone doesn't design, but it certainly deepens relationships with the body.Williams' first Nike collection explored the ways data is informing new manufacturing methods of the T-shirt (heat and sweat maps transformed to structural patterns). For his second capsule, he focused on how data reveals things that are normally unseen.""For this collection, we used computational algorithms to create the camouflage pattern,"" he says. Camouflage, of course, traditionally derives from nature. With data, Williams is able to toy with hidden-in-plain-sight natural shapes to arrive at a new motif.The pattern isn't just trend-driven (Williams views camouflage as season-less and always relevant) but also appropriate to one of the functional purposes of the products: equipping athletes for what Williams describes as ""really hardcore outdoor training."" He's thinking of things like flipping tires, hauling sandbags uphill and traversing obstacle courses. But, understanding holistic training, he's also thinking adaptability between varied fitness pursuits — lifting, sprinting and taking group classes.To that end, there's a mix of Sherpa fleece, two-in-one pants, utility vests and detachable hoods. Everything is about multi-functional use. Data also informs the paneling on the tops. “When you're running, you get wet mainly the top of your shoulders, so we ensuredrain coverage in thatspot,"" Williams explains.An added touch of humanity comes in the accessories range. Athletes need socks and underwear. Williams dutifully provides both.The Nike x MMWcollection releases January 19 at an exclusive pop-up shop in Paris, France. It will be available globally beginningFebruary 7."
"The Converse x JW Anderson Run Star HikeJonathan Anderson’s latest collaboration with Conversebegan with an established desire — merge a Chuck Taylor with a runner — and quickly evolved as a study in blending a Converse icon with a new, very different Converse silhouette. The result, the Converse x JW Anderson Run Star Hike,drew immediate attention when it debuted during the designer’s Spring/Summer 2019 Collection show last September in London.In principle, the silhouetteis adeclaration on contemporary mash-up culture, while in practice, it'sa deft articulation of gamesome exploration of proportion and stance.“Contrasting proportions have always been part of my design aesthetic. When I approached this latest Converse, I was looking to re-create the same aesthetic by pairing the sole of a Run Starwith the classic Chuck Taylor to emphasize the proportions,” says Anderson.This approach presented a challenge in engineering: how to retain integrity of individual parts and still present a strong catalyst for visceral reaction.Thus, building the Converse x JW Anderson Run Star Hike required some ingenuity in design. Anderson didn't touch the upper; it rounds the foot with the samegraceful, narrow sweep as it did in the '70s. He accentuated this simple shaping by using the tooling of the Converse Run Star, a heritage-style, injection-molded running shoe. It'sthe antithesis of the Chuck in terms of chunk andpresents an intriguing stack height.Scale was also added through the addition of a sawtooth tread, effectively forming a three-part shoe (upper, midsole, outsole) wherein each portion can be read easily from distance.The date “1917” honors the birth of the All-Star."
"The Converse x P.A.M. collection taps the versatility and cross-cultural adoption of the Chuck 70 across decadesto create a sneaker that muses function with new world styling, allowing the wearer to adapt and interpret it on their own.When unzipped, the silhouette transforms into a canvas slip-on Chuck 70 with a dual-branded tongue patch and gold side panel.Perks and Mini (P.A.M.) co-founders Misha Hollenbach and Shauna Toohey believe even the most classic of silhouettesbenefit frommutations inform —as long as itsphysicaltransformation contemplates the future.“Mutation is about evolution and the idea of what’s to come, what the future could be. It is not a rigid or singular way of thinking. It is an openness. We mustadapt,"" say the designers.The Paris-based lifestyle brand taps into that themewith its collaborative take on the Chuck 70 and select Converse apparel. The collection is highlighted by thesneaker, which is engineered with PrimaLoft®, a thermal material from the '80s, to form anupper that can be fully removed with a zipper.Whenunzipped, the silhouettemutates intoa canvas slip-on Chuck 70 with a dual-branded tongue patch and gold side panel.The connected apparelincludes a Track Pant, Hoodie,Long and Short-Sleeve Shirtand a reversible Quilted Bomber Jacket that'scompletely crafted inPrimaLoft®withfunctional side pockets, graphicsleeveartwork and a heat transfer graphic on the back.The reversible Quilted Bomber JacketThe Long-Sleeve ShirtThe HoodieThe Short-Sleeve ShirtThe HoodieThe Track PantThe Converse xP.A.M. collection will be availableJanuary 19 on converse.com and at select retailers."
"The world's best finishers — the likes of American Alex Morgan and Englishman Harry Kane — have something in common: Each knows that for every perfect, thrilling set ball goal, there are dozens of toe taps, heel flicks and hits off the outside of the foot. The value on the score sheet is the same, and the most proficient scorers come equipped with a nose for a goal and a litany of skills for converting their opportunities.""My finishing is a balance between power and placement,""says USWNT star Alex Morgan.""It depends where I am in the box, but I'd say my focus is usually 60/40accuracy versuspower.”That style of finishing is why the design of the PhantomVNM features a series of textured zones to facilitate a powerful strike, but with an understanding that all of the power in the world won’t score without the accuracy to keep the shot on goal. This emphasis is most evident in the instep’s Precision Pwrstrike zone.The 13 ridges of the instep's Precision Pwr strike zone are set at specific angles and ascending heights to help keep the ball down if it is mishit and to provide bite on the ball.The plate, which takes inspiration from Nike Free, is flexible in the forefoot for toeing off the ground with torque for sharp cuts.PhantomVNM increases the strike zone area by covering the laces, giving PhantomVNM a 30-percentlarger strike zone thanHypervenom3.“We teamed up with our research lab to utilize a robotic leg to test strikes from a variety of angles with urethane injected ‘blades’ across the instep,” notes Jeongwoo Lee, Senior Design Director for Nike Football Footwear. “This enabled us to go deep statistically on the impact that thevarious blade iterations had on accuracy, elevation, power and spin. The lab data helped us land on the exact specifications of Precision Pwr strike zonebuilt for finishers.”The 13 ridges of the Precision Pwr strike zone are set at specific angles and ascending heights to help keep the ball down if it is mishit and to provide bite on the ball. Much like its counterpart in thePhantom family, PhantomVNM increases the strike zone area by covering the laces, giving PhantomVNM a 30-percentlarger strike zone thanHypervenom3. But, PhantomVNM does build off the Hyper-Reactive plate made famous on the Hypervenom3. The plate, which takes inspiration from Nike Free, is flexible in the forefoot for toeing off the ground with torque for sharp cuts. This iteration of the HyperReactive plate also strays from traditional plates by exposing its faceted structure. This aesthetic alsocarries over to the premium faceted Swoosh.The PhantomVNMlaunches January 19 on nike.com. A small-sided version, featuring Zoom Air cushioning, will also be available."
"Founded in 2011, Tokyo-based Cav Empt is the brainchild of renowned graphic artist Sk8thing and England-born Toby Feltwell. Collaborating with Nike, the duo are able to tie their distinct outlook, a marriage of respective creative talents with British and Japanese reference points, to a set of core sportswear classics: the Air Max 95, a track suit, a jersey, a cap and a vest.""In the early 2000s, a Nike Tracksuit paired with Nike Air max was the uniform of the London Streets. We started C.E. a decade later, and though we were in Tokyo, images from that time and place have been consistently with us,"" says Toby Feltwell. ""We looked at this opportunity to work with Nike as a way to interact with these images more directly. We are engaging in a sort of time travel. The project with Nike has allowed us to work in the present to redesign our past.""The articulation of the Nike x C.E. tracksuit pant is evidence of this action. A cinching behind the knee changes the silhouette from a straight leg to a more attractive, updated fit. As Feltwell notes, C.E.'s approachis notan exercisein authenticity. ""We're not directly appropriating stuff, but we're seeing various things that interest us and trying to highlight them,"" he says.This theme carries into the patterns and word play that C.E. has become synonymous with. Rather than spoon feed the obvious, they're pleased to offer an entry point for discovery — nothing ventured, nothing gained — that bucks easy access trends.""There's always been things out there where you felt that the brand had left behindatrail of bread crumbs that allowed you to go on a path to discover something that you wouldn't have known about otherwise. We feel that we're carrying on a tradition in that sense,"" says Feltwell.The Nike x Cav Empt collection releases January 5 at Cav Empt'sTokyo store and on cavempt.com.

"Vince Staples' take on the Convese ThunderboltIt was a search through the Converse archives where SoCal-bornVince Staples explored a question that so often serves as a baseline for his songwriting: What happens when intended function is overridden by modern-day adoption?Staples found a starting point in the Converse Thunderbolt, and he uses the sometimes outlandish appropriation of traditional running gear to drive his creative collaboration with the brand.A varsity jacket is among three pieces of apparel within Staples' new collectionOn the Thunderbolt, natural, transparent colors and textures are juxtaposed with contrast stitching, high gloss/reflective accents and a graphical language representative of modern Californianaesthetics. This graphic language is most prominent in the collection’s “RUN” graphic, crafted in an archived‘80s style font and 3D printed onto the heel of the sneaker.The accompanying three-piece apparel collection consists of a track pant, crewand varsity jacket, each of which have distinctive stitch piping. The apparel is further unified by a key color, vibrant orange, which is a nod to Vince’s first collection with Converse and contrasts the collection’s milder and darker tones.The Converse x Vince Staples Thunderbolt and associated apparel drops December 18 on converse.com and at select retailers."
"Martine Rosebegan designing her version of the Nike Air Monarch byfitting a size 18 upper to size 9 tooling, resulting in this extraordinary shape.“I have never been interested in fashion. I've always been interested in how people interact with clothes,” says London-based menswear designer Martine Rose.Her first collaboration with Nike, a capsule featuring tracksuits, football jerseys and a completely re-articulated Nike Air Monarch, is indicative of this fascination. It plays, as much of Rose’s work does, on distorted proportion. Similarly, it follows the ethos of her design: finding things that appear ordinary but have something extraordinary about them and transforming those into items that are, in Rose’s words, “really quite exceptional.”Most often, the transformation takes place in experimenting with form fit. It is always also an exercise in rule breaking and clashing context.“When we started, we never just followed the rules, really because our access was blocked. For one reason or another we had to find different ways to show,” says Rose. And though her brand now has staged shows in local London markets and rock-climbing gyms, when it came to her Nike collaboration, Rose revisited her roots and opted for a clandestine collection launchlast week. The location?Craig’s List — a digital space far removed from hype cycle norms.As for the clashing contexts, here are the key elements behind the formation of Rose’s Nike collaboration:Excess material on the track pant is framed by a pleat on the wearer’s right leg.The jacquard football jersey is highlighted by an elongated striped neck rib, and its oversized fit is augmented with excess volume pleated into the sleeve.For the tracksuitand football shirt, the process began with a spot of imagination — a seven-foot spot, to be exact. “Basketball players are superhuman — their bodies have formed in different ways because of their profession. We looked at a lot of players and their proportions. We then re-imagined their clothes on average-size people. For example, if I were wearing one of their tracksuits, I would have to repurpose it in order to fit my proportions; I’d have to tuck the seams,” explains Rose.“It was very intentional to use the Monarch as the silhouette, being a very American shoe, and then put it with the very English silhouette of the tracksuit,” says Rose.To give that very ordinary shoe a very extraordinary shape, Rose relied on Nike’s undisputed expertise in footwear. “Collaborations are about communication. We wanted some of the forms to spill over the base and we wanted the heel on the outfit to be further out than the sole…things we were initially told couldn't be done,” she says. “But everyone kept on pushing and we ended up developing these new shapes and ideas.”The shape itself follows on the same imaginative exercise as the apparel, but with more even experimentation — beginning with fitting a size 18 upper to size 9 tooling. Bringing this vision to commercial life required inventive development. Thus, Rose’s Air Monarch was built as a series of molds that weretopped with stretched synthetic leather. Only one shoe has a similar construction, itself an American standard: the Nike Foamposite.Though ubiquitous, silhouettes from sport are now as common on the high street as on a Paris runway. For Rose, this speaks less to trend and more to spiritual connection.“Sportswear has been appropriated for years by various youth movements in England and America. The acceptability makes it so interesting. People can mix it in with any other type of wardrobe,” she says. “Again, I’m very interested with how people interact with clothes. It says so much about who they are, who they want to be. It’s an emotional thing.”The Nike x Martine Rose collection releases in January. More images availablehere."

"For Concepts Creative Director Deon Point, Kyrie Irving’s latest signature shoe, the KYRIE 5, is proof that “the marriage of technology and aesthetic is a beautiful thing.”Point recalls being in Paris when he first got the call to work on the KYRIE 5, being awed by the shoe’s design and, moreover, instantly motivated by the opportunity to work with a player who is deeply engaged in sneaker culture.“With Kyrie being such an amazing basketball player, you'd really think he has no time to do anything else,"" says Point. ""But to see him sit down with the Nike Basketball guys and hash out these details — things I know are painstaking and probably tough to even bring to fruition — is nuts, man.""The red tongue references what experts say the Sphinx’s nose looked like prior to its degradation.The connection between Irving and his new collaborative partners — whohave been defining Boston’s streetwear scene since 1996 — held an emotive tie before there was a proximity. Irving’s embrace of Nike SB, past and present, is well known. Priorspecial-editions of his signature line have paid respect to favored SB colorways, and last year, Concepts’ famed Lobster motif graced versions of the KYRIE 4.“These guys are unbelievable creatives. What I love is that Concepts has always identified specific cultural touchpoints and pushed things that make them their own,” says Irving.With Irving, the Conceptsidea draws from the all-seeing eye within the athlete’s Hamsa hand tattoo. Rather than replicate it (given that the tattooisa major theme of the KYRIE 5 heel counter and box), Point decided to dig into the history of Egypt’s ancient pyramids. “I found out the mortar used remains a mystery to scientists — they still can't figure how it stuck together, but it's some of the strongest stuff ever made. I learned that the limestone glowing in the sun made the pyramids glow brighter than a diamond. Andone thing that really got me: there was a 20-ton door on one of the pyramids that was so precise, you can’t squeeze a credit card through the seams —but it can be opened with one hand,” he says.These facts, figures and myths combine in the Concepts x KYRIE 5 Ikhet to form an intriguing play of color and modeling. Theygivedimension to the shoe’s distinctive flytrap lacing, which is imbued with the type of nuances Point and team are known for.“It's a great collaboration with great people behind it who are thinking outside of the box. That's what you need sometimes in order to create great things,"" says Irving.""Just having a shoe with Concepts is awesome. People are like, ‘Wait. This is a rare Nike shoe?’ You're damn right it is.”The purple sole captures the color of the sunset against the pyramids.For Concepts, the shoe represents a merging of brand ethos and civic pride. “To us, nothing is more exciting than the Boston Celtics,"" says Point. ""I used to sitoutside the Garden listening to gameson the radio, just wishing I could score a ticket to get in when they were dominating throughout the '80s. Being able to work with someone as talented as Kyrie is not only a dream come true, but to have him be in a Celtics uniform while we're doing it — it's mind-blowing.”The Concepts x KYRIE 5 Ikhet launches December 26."
"For many sneaker and basketball fans, the natural answer to the question “What’s your grail?”is the Air Jordan XI Concord. The nuances of that answer lie in the strength of the shoe’s historical context and the longstanding power of its design.In 1995, MJ shocked the world when he announced his return from retirement with a simple message —“I’m Back.”When he returned to the floor, he sported a #45 jersey, with #23 already hanging in the rafters. If that wasn’t enough to make fans scratch their heads, he also had something foreign on his feet. No one had seen anything like it. A white upper, while the rest of his team was wearing black? Check. A league fine for breaking uniform rules? Check. Patent leather on a basketball shoe? Check.But how? When the rest of the world was mourning His Airness’s departure from the court, legendary sneaker designer Tinker Hatfield remained in the kitchen cooking. He knew MJ had a love for the game that would lead him back to the hardwood. Sure enough, Jordan returned and Hatfield’s creation, the Air Jordan XI Concord, hit the court, changing the course of sneakers forever — again.Not only is MJ responsible for making Air Jordans part of basketball history on the court, he’s also credited with creating some of his signature line’s most iconic features. Dating back to the design of the AJ IX, MJ had been asking Hatfield and his design team to push the envelope and incorporate patent leather. His reasoning was twofold:First and foremost, the patent leather would help keep his forefoot locked-in on quick stops and cuts. MJ also predicted the patent leather would be a hit off the court, even going as far as saying people would wear them on red carpets and at other formal events. Hatfield, who admits to being initially skeptical of MJ’s suggestion, eventually bought into the idea and added it to the AJ XI. By the time people internally saw the design, they weren’t asking, “Why the shiny leather?”, they were asking why he was making another signature model for the retired MJ in the first place. He knew MJ well enough to know the AJ XI would get its time to shine.Jordan Brand family member Victor Oladipo in the Air Jordan XI Concord.Jordan Brand family member Victor Oladipo in the Air Jordan XI Concord.The history books will tell you MJ lost that year’s playoff series against Orlando, but they miss the most important part: MJ never lost, he learned. That series would fuel him in the off-season and inspire him to lead his team to a historic season and eventual second three-peat.By the time he took the floor for the following season, the word had spread. These were not just basketball shoes, they were the “Concords,” the ultimate grail. Every fan, diehard and casual, needed to have them. Whether at awards shows or on court, they made a statement wherever they appeared. Soon, it was out with the dress shoes and in with the Concords. Graduation? Lace them up. Wedding? “I do” to the XIs.Annually, the AJ XI is highly anticipated during the holidays. This year, the Air Jordan XI Concord gets passed to the next generation so it can change the game just like MJ did. Highlights include the original patent leather cut, Nike Air details on the insole, original box and the #45 on the heel — just like when they debuted on court.The Air Jordan XI Concord releases globally in full family sizing December 8.

"Nike’s first collaborative project with Fear of God founder and creative director Jerry Lorenzo is highlighted by an court-ready basketball shoe, the NikeAir Fear of God 1. During the last few weeks, glimpses of the design — which incorporates a double-height Zoom Air heel unit — came through a preview of Lorenzo’s latest Fear of God offering and then appeared on the feet of NBA stars. The rollout is tactical, all part of Lorenzo’s desire to focus on the emotional element of sport.Jerry Lorenzo's court-ready Nike Air Fear of God 1Jerry Lorenzo's court-ready Nike Air Fear of God 1“It is a shoe that should only be judged by the emotion it gives the kid when he first sees it — however it makes him feel,” says the Los Angeles-based designer. “We live in a day and age when images are leaked left and right, and products are leaked without consideration and emotional attachments. I’m aiming to give a visceral experience whether the kid sees it first on Ben Simmons coming into the arena or worn by his favorite athletes on court.”Lorenzo wants to tap into a certain element of nostalgia. Not so much aboutwhat was worn, but how it was worn. He wants to awaken a spirit he deems dormant, to remind of the power sport once had in defining style.“In my youth…growing up in the ’80s and finishing high school in the ’90s, contrary to what's happening now, it was our superstar athletes and our pro athletes that were informing the way that we wore our street clothes,” he says. “These athletes, like Agassi and Jordan, were at the top of their game and what they wore didn’t compromise on design or beauty.”The visible Nike Air window houses a game-changing double stack Zoom heel.Working withLeo Chang,Senior Footwear Design Director, Nike Basketball, on the Nike Air Fear of God footwear allowed Lorenzo to balance his aesthetic vision and performance aspiration. Says Lorenzo of Chang, “He’s someone with a phenomenal desire, who understands innovation and performance at a high level. He’s also patient and open to not only a new designer but a new design process.” This meant a lot of patience on both sides, Lorenzo says. “In order to create a product that doesn'tcompromise style or innovation, you can’t make concessions to process.”Process is something Lorenzo says came from his athletic background in baseball and basketball. In sport, he found a foundation for how to go about life. The competitiveness that drove relative success on the field has been translated to his work as a designer.Recently, Lorenzo found that Nike’s 30th anniversary Just Do It campaigns affirmed the value of sport in all facets of life. Led by Colin Kaepernick, the lead spot, Dream Crazy, reminded Lorenzo that “there are people outside of sport who go about their lives through the spirit of sport.”And that is where he wants his collection to sit — within the soul of the wearer.“This is for all the kids coming up in small cities with big-city dreams,” Lorenzo concludes. “It’s about what he feels he should have, not what he thinks he should have based on what society's telling him.”The Nike Air Fear of God collection releases December 15."
"These days, the word “icon” is casually applied to everything from online video clips to sweet potato pies. By formal definition, however, an iconis ""a person who is very successful and admired” or “a widely known symbol.” The Nike Air Force 1, which debuted in 1982 and has since served as a canvas for artists and designers of all ilk, indisputably achieves thelatter classification. During the decades, the AF1'siconic design has undergone subtle updates to reflect the current moment, without sacrificing its distinct DNA. Inits mutability — because of it —the shoe has become a global street culture standard. See how, below."
"When Jordan Brand’s designers heard Union owner Chris Gibbs’s idea for a vintage-styled Air Jordan footwear and apparel capsule, they were sold. They just had one question — what year?“We’re referencing an era, late ’80s early ’90s,” explains Gibbs, an industry veteran who grew up during that era and understands that streetwear is at its best when it captures a vibe and is unencumbered by the strict technicalities of history.Gibbs frequents Los Angeles-area flea markets and vintage stores and is thus familiar with the Jordan touch points of his youth and how those have aged over time. “The Jordan stuff I wear now is like if I go to a vintage market and I find some really old stuff that’s kind of patinaed or weathered in,” he says. “To me, the vintage nature of it allows you to kind of wear it outside of its intended purpose.”Taking Union’s reputation for elevated taste and commitment to quality fabrics and construction, the Union x Air Jordan collection carefully captures that transcendence. It pulls from a golden era in sports and streetwear — a tone evoked by the color of the wash on the apparel to the careful distressing on the Air Jordan Is.The shoes also capture Gibbs’s approach with a fresh perspective on the mashup. Each fuses together classic AJI colorways with a noticeable stitch mark, evidence of a process that celebrates DYI culture and vintage hunting. Gibbs describes the inspiration as finding your most coveted pair of sneakers at the flea market, thenelevating it by combining it with another pair to create a unique 1-of-1.For the apparel, Gibbs leaned into his past experience to balance the right look and fit. “One of the things we worked on was the drape,” said Gibbs. “I’ve learned from buying and selling a lot of high fashion that once you get through your normal silhouette of a T-shirt and a jean — garments that everybody can kind of do — there is really a lot of attention placed on how garments fall on the body.”Subsequently, the collection, which features T-shirts, sweatshirts and pants, has been washed and distressed to perfectly match the era that Union wanted to reference. At first glance, it looks like a vintage-haul jackpot.The Union x Air Jordan capsule releases November 17 at select retailers. Additionally, the White, Black, Varsity Red, Grey AJI will be available on SNKRS in EMEA, Greater China and North America. The White, Storm Blue, Black, Varsity Red AJI will be available exclusively at Union."
"The Nike Zoom Vomero +5 x A-COLD-WALL* is produced to discolor rapidly. ""It's about actually owning a product and working a product in,"" says A-COLD-WALL* designer, founder and creative director Samuel Ross. ""I find that there is quite a beauty in that.""How does an object change with use or over time? This question is the driving force behind Samuel Ross's work on the Nike x A–COLD–WALL* Capsule Collection, starring a radical reworking of the 2010 Nike Zoom Vomero +5. ""I am interested in how a garment ages and in taking the user on that journey. That is something I believe should be encouraged. It's much more human. It's much more dynamic as well,"" says the London-born designer.The Nike x A–COLD–WALL* Capsule Collection reflects this philosophy in inventive fabrics, including a technical Japanese nylon that softens with warmth and heat, and the removal of PU coatings from the Nike Zoom Vomero +5 to accelerate the aging process (manifested by a yellowing).The Nike x A–COLD–WALL* Parka allows for two dynamic fits. ""First is the classic overbearing overcoat with a dramatic silhouette. The other is toward an incredibly modern, and actually quite exposed and unresolved, cropped high jacket,"" says Ross.In this, the collection neatly follows Ross's first Nike project, a Nike AF1 High, which was designed to highlight the shoe’s individual components through subtle shifts in color from gray to white, reversed leathers and a disguised Swoosh (just its stitch was left). However, the employment of dynamic materials allows Ross's theory to mature as well. His ideas balance an active and static state — each piece in the collection is attractive as sculpture, but most enchanting when lived in.""With the Vomero, there has been this opportunity to really exalt the technology of its time and modernize the aesthetic, which is uncompromised to its purpose and function,"" says Ross. ""It's interesting to look at a shoe which has such a beautiful and polished wire frame, and then to be able to isolate individual aspects of that shoe, to really exalt the technology. It is very exciting to take something that is very beautiful and to not necessarily reinterpret but to reevaluate the product.""As with the AF1, Ross draws the eye to specific components in the Vomero; by manipulating the lifespan of the colors he forces continual reaction to those elements as the materials shift with wear. This creates a subtlety that juxtaposes the architectonic form of the heel counter so that the smallest details reach a harmony with the more overt styling.""With the garments that we produce with Nike, there is this element of sophistication weaved through the simplistic shapes, which have these small details,"" says Ross. ""Those details come down to the use of things, like Japanese nylon on the Parka, something that is initially coarse but with wear actually soften.""Ross describes the Nike x A–COLD–WALL* pant having ""a very stark and staunch and hostile feel.""Outerwear, in many ways, has been the driving force of A-COLD-WALL*. In producing coats and jackets, Ross has found opportunity to explore technical materials — like those used in this collection — and find a true communicative force for his brand ethos. With Nike, Ross also advances his approach to legwear. Take the Nike x A–COLD–WALL* pant. ""Cropping the pant and adding this tension around the back of the knee joint really gives it a very stark and staunch and hostile feel. This is the first time I have really tried to capture the energy of the outerwear in a trouser, and it pairs so well with the sneaker,"" he says.Within each portion of the collection, the story of an aging process is continued. The more one wears a piece in, truly lets it live, the more it changes. And with that, the Nike x A–COLD–WALL* Capsule Collection champions not just an exciting use of materials, but the raw energy and lifecycle of a product.The Nike x A–COLD–WALL* Capsule Collection launches November 17exclusively in London. A global release follows November 29."
"This Nike Air Force 1, showcasing a range of historical logos, highlights the capacity of Nike Flyleather to take print — and foreshadows its potential future as the substrate of retro choice.Nike Flyleather is a new super material. It is made with at least 50 percent recycled natural leather fiber. That matters, because it means Nike Flyleather deftly balances a much-loved tactile quality with an important reduction in the carbon footprint and water usage required to manufacture it.It's also cool because — if we're thinking about the future — Nike Flyleather becomes the answer to retaining the qualities intrinsic to some of Nike's greatest icons (think the Air Force 1 and Air Jordan 1) with an environmentally responsible process.Nike Flyleather is good for more than replicationtoo. It has properties — unique fiber characteristics,controllable modification and a less dense, uniform structure of leather-rich substrate — that create improved opportunitiesfor laser and print embellishment andtextural explorations through embossing and other machinations.What does this do for future Nike icons? The gallery below offers a tease of the potential:Think full grain and smooth leatherand suede (which actually comes from the reverse side of a Nike Flyleatherroll).Both embossing and embossing effects can create strong texture plays on Nike Flyleather, seen on this custom AF1.Sharp and smooth.Offering a fresh take on branding opportunities.For more, check out these images."
"A painting by artist Aaron Elvis Jupin depicts the chaos and deconstruction mentaility that Brain Dead founders Kyle Ng and Ed Davis were striving for in their Converse collaboration.The text on the Converse x Brain Dead Chuck 70 reads: “To see and be seen as far as the eye can see. Who Controls the Control Men. The same elsewhere.”Converse first applied a graphic pattern — a camouflage print — to the Chuck Taylor All Star in 1983. Glow-in-the-dark animal prints followed in 1988, a patriotic American Flag print in 1991and since then innumerable motifs have graced sneaker culture's most recognizable silhouette.These archival prints form the starting point for the new collaborative project between Converse and Los Angeles-based creative collective Brain Dead. Led by founders Kyle Ng and Ed Davis, Brain Dead takes an unexpected, unique approach to retooling the iconic Chuck 70, and debuts subversive spins on archetypal garments like the MA-1. ""People always expect us to do graphic work,” says Ng. “We wanted to take a more conceptual approach with Converse. We were inspired by pattern deconstruction — we were interested in creating chaos with something that already existed.”The Chuck 70 is the most apparent example of this, taking a variety of prints (animal, American flag, camo) and bringing them together. If the intent was to baffle the eye, the end result was a surprise — at least for the Brain Dead crew.""The weird thing is, because these are classic patterns, it works together in harmony,"" says Ng.What could have served as a point of tension became a point of distinction, and subsequently the backbone of the whole project, where preexisting icons are reworked with a dissident eye. This speaks to Brain Dead's creative spark, and the elasticity of the Converse brand's place in a variety of subcultures.""The Chuck is an icon. But the spirit of the brand is iconoclastic — that's important to the way we look at collaborations,"" says Brook Bergland, Converse Apparel Design Director. ""For example, with Brain Dead, we took the fleece hoodie and the MA-1 and we subverted both classics to create a hybrid that is unified by a PrimaLoft lining.""The garment, the Converse x Brain Dead Hooded Bomber Jacket, is a testament to the notion that disparate points of view create new and often very interesting ideas. Here, the sanctity of apparel standards is destroyed in favor of experimenting with ""what-if"" potential.""The mash-up of the hoody and the jacket is part of the deconstruction mentality — we're dissembling things and putting them together to make something new,"" Ng explains.The Converse x Brain Dead Hooded Bomber Jacket.

Wohooooow!"" collection.“Traveling. Visiting each other. Getting to know each other. For us, that is where the collaboration between Nike and Patta started,” explains Patta’s Vincent Van de Waal.“We wanted to make head-to-toe outerwear, but have it somehow feel like a tracksuit, so we adjusted existing Nike silhouettes to make it our own,” says Patta's Vincent Van de Waal. Photo by Stephen Tayo.The inside of thecheckered jacket is quilted and fleece-lined, and features the collaboration's namesake: ""Publicity. Publicity. Wohooooow!"" Photo by Stephen Tayo.On the back of the dark obsidian jacket isa large white flag, which Van de Waal says is ""an invitation to project messages on,to color, to write on and to vandalize.” Photo by Stephen Tayo.The phrase, ""Publicity. Publicity. Wohooooow!,” stems from another sort of collaboration — the spontaneous “happenings” of 1960s avant garde artists, like Amsterdam’s Robert Jasper Grootveld. For the Patta crew, these engagements remind of a need not just for self-awareness and irony, but as Van de Waal notes, about how branded items become an act in space as well.Thus, a requisite boldnessholds key position in the collection. Apparel was chosen as a way to mix technical elements with classics. “We wanted to make head-to-toe outerwear, but have it somehow feel like a tracksuit, so we adjusted existing Nike silhouettes to make it our own,” says Van de Waal.It's running sportswear, but not. Technical, but casual. Most important, it's an exercise in expressing and blending the performative elements of sport with those of style.Evidence of this thought comes through in the checkered suit, which is, in fact, an homage to a pioneering jazz musicianwho asked following his final Paris concert not “How did I play?” but “How did I look?”While the reference there is overt, on the other suit — the dark obsidian with bold typography— the inspiration is open-ended. The back features a large white flag, which Van de Waal explains: “The white flag bearer is historically the one who seeks to negotiate. We associate the white flag with peace, seize fire and surrender: a positive symbol in an increasingly polarizing society and public space. The white flag is also an invitation to project messages on,to color, to write on and to vandalize.”Fittingly, Patta broadens its collaboration with a more literal invitation, giving space to extended family to share their unique perspectives on the output as a series of campaigns that form “happenings” both physically and digitally. Thework is collated in a book, created in collaboration with Linda van Deursen, featuring all 11artists, includingBart Julius Peters, Dana Lixenberg, Oko Ebombo, Nigel Shafran, Qiu Yang, Joyce Ng, Morgan Knibbe, Vincent Van de Waal, Violette Esmeralda, Sam de Jong and Stephen Tayo. A short filmby Morgan Knibbe can be viewed here.The final flourish of the collaboration is the Air Max 90 x 95. “Both silhouettes are amongour favorites,"" says Van de Waal.""The Air Max90 is a robust classic, and the 95 has always felt like a futuristic design; combining both forms a mix between classic and more technical design.”By way of Nike by You, the mix is also available for further customization, broadening (again) the nature of the collaboration and inviting all participants an opportunityto give the shoea personal spin.The Nike By You Air Max 90 x 95. Photo by Stephen Tayo.Van de Waal says of the Nike By You Air Max 90 x 95: ""The Air Max90 is a robust classic, and the 95 has always felt like a futuristic design; combining both forms a mix between classic and more technical design.” Photo by Stephen Tayo.The ""Publicity.

"For Kendrick Lamar, fashion and lifestyle are synonymous. “When we are talking about lifestyle, we are talking about real lives, actual people,” he explains.With this focus, Lamar sees great value in bringing a real grounding to his Nike output, holding up “creativity as the only goal.” That’s apparent in the fourth Nike Cortez Kenny, which takes the Cortez’s classic lines and applies a simplicity and convenience of use from an Angelino staple: the house shoe.“House shoes have always been part of LA culture,” says Lamar. His intent with the Kenny IV was to retain the ease and comfort of the slipper, but also allow people to still feel sleek. “The shoe is all about being able to get up and just go out in style.”In that vein, Lamar believes the shoe successfully attaches personal thought to classic, vintage style. What’s more, it synthesizes the values of Lamar’s home community in an unbounded way. Lamar notes that, in the shoe’s making, he was fascinated by all the possible color palettes and the many ways you can give a shoe character.This experience provided Lamar more insight on the process of designing and stoked his individual love for Nike anew. ""To actually sit in the room with people just as passionate as I am about creating, lets me know that Nike has always had a driven purpose,"" he says.Having touched digital commerce with a first-of-its-kind in arenaSNKRS drop and pop-up experiences, Lamar's collaborative efforts with Nike extend well beyond the Cortez silhouette. This underscores his desire to connect with community — both physically and emotionally — by never forgetting the human element.""With ideas being open and honest, our possibility has no boundaries,"" Lamar says of his future with Nike.The Nike Cortez Kenny IV “House Shoe” releases October 14."
"Tom Sachs holds the Nike Mars Yard Overshoe.The initial need for the Nike Mars Yard Overshoe was simple: In late winter, one's feet get cold and wet.“The Mars Yard Overshoe, its nickname is the March Yard — for March, the worst month of the year. It is wet, your feet are wet the whole month of March,” says Tom Sachs. Simple.Butits story is more complex — one of trials and errors, questions and answers.Sachs learns by doing, more explicitly by making, most directly by testing. The artist, who came to fame as a sculptor and now works across a variety of media, embraces transparency in materials and the underpinnings of how things work.His collaborative journey with Nike, under the moniker NIKECraft, is no exception. “NIKECraft is an adjective,"" says Sachs.""It means a combination of things only Nike can produce and things only Sachs can produce. It is fifty-fifty. It is an aesthetic of transparency.""A full, transparentbreakdown of the Nike Mars Yard OvershoeIf Sachs learns by doing (his first Nike product arrived in 2012, his experience in footwear expanding exponentially since then), he reveals areas of intrigue by questioning.This often happens bypushing the limits of an item's function. Sachs wants to know not just why something works, but how far it will work — always with unrelenting vigor. Thiscan disrupt Nike design-thinking (Sachsis damn good at rallying a fresh perspective on solutions), but italso gives him cause to find fresh angles for himself. Again, NIKECraft is a fifty-fifty enterprise.“For me, the biggest challenge I’ve overcome stems from this: Itis very easy to make things in the studio. We have a privilege, and an advantage, because we make things one at a time. We are like a 19th-century-style workshop. When you do things the Nike way, you engineer for the manufacturing process,"" he explains. ""As an artist, the greatest thing Nike has given me is the ability to expand my creative process and think ‘these are not constraints, these are other ways of thinking.’ It’s very valuable.""For example, Sachs found that,through heavy daily use,the initial Mars Yard shoe didn’t meet his expectations.His work as an impromptuwear-tester (now more recognizedand more standardized — the Sachs studio is actually the first true urban wear-test center in Nike history)led to the Mars Yard 2.0 in 2017.Thisreplaced the original Vectran®️ upper with a polyester warp-knit tricot mesh and inverted the tread of the outsole for more appropriate wear in urban environments.Sachs' latest Nike project, the Mars Yard Overshoe, is an extension of this process. It's all about working under the consideration of how the Mars Yard 2.0 performs when conditionssour.What could Sachs employ to transition his equipment?Answering for questions of weather appropriateness, it allowed frustrations (freakout-inducing cold, wetfeet) to channelsolutions (the employment of aDyneema®️, a super-strong fiber often used in boat rope and sails). Experience also diversified function. While wearing the Overshoe all the way up fendsoff the elements, rolling it down makes inside, heated spaces tolerable. The duality serves well for the annoyances of aNew York March, and allows chic navigation of street, subway and fashion week. A new tread pattern, created by a small sipingat the highpoints of the outsole, is designed from a mastery of New York's winters too.As with all of Sachs' product, the Mars Yard Overshoebalances the rawhonesty of the materials and manufacturingwiththe artist's touch.In celebration of the London premiere of Sachs’ latest filmParadox Bullets, alimited release of the Nike Mars Yard Overshoe will be available October 11 at DSM London. (Product available in-store only via online raffle. Conditions apply. Please follow DSM for details). A global release date for the shoe will be announced in the coming months."

With it, Nike unleashed a string of bold, industry-defining designs suited for wear in the weight room, on the court and across turf. Anunintended, but swiftly realized, product of those arresting designs was a versatile adoption by the era’s musical subcultures.Introduced in 1990, the Air Cross Trainer 3 Low extends aesthetic cues fromthe Air Trainer SC High. It was defined by a subtle upper color scheme, accented by pops of color on the tongue and midsole — a characteristic that remains in its 2020 version.

Even more enticing than its lightweight feel was its ability to stand out on the pitch: the cleat’s vibrant orange pop of color from the tongue, heel graphic, stud tips and laces created a stark contrast from the black premium leather upper (a signature of the Tiempo franchise). Nike Flywire technology was integrated into the leather for a midfoot lockdown and, overall, more dynamic fit, while enhanced vamp stitching was strategically placed for lateral agility.With tribute to itspredecessor, the latest Nike Tiempo Legend 8 gets OG Tiempo Legend IV Elite color treatment.Its fit and feel is defined by the Legend 8’s stitchless, quilted diamond pattern upper and Flyknit Fit Tunnel, providing a supportive and snug fit around the midfoot.Additionally, the boot has Quadfit mesh in the forefoot to prevent overstretch of theouter leather layer.The boot is the fourth and final release fromNike Football’sFuture DNA Pack, in which Nike’s current performance boots each pay homage to a classic Nike Football design, and follows the release of theNike Phantom VSN 2 Future DNA Hypervenom, theNike Mercurial Vapor Future DNA Mercurialand theNike Phantom VNM Future DNA T90.The NikeTiempoFuture DNATiempo Legendis available March 27 on nike.com.March 20, 2020 - The Nike Phantom VNM Future DNA T90brings classic Nike Football design to one of the brand’s latest on-pitchinnovations.Originally released in 2002, the Nike Air Zoom Total 90 IIwas the perfect blend of comfort, power and precision. Made of soft KN-100 —a strong, lightmaterial —the boot’s namesake stemmed from the creation of a cleat that would support player comfort for the total 90 minutes of a match. The cleat featured asymmetrical, off-center lacing for a larger boot-to-ball surface (which helps createa cleaner strike), as well as Zoom Air units in the outsole for optimal traction and stud pressure reduction.The Nike Phantom VNM Future DNA T90 paystribute to its predecessor’s classic black, white and red colorway, and translates the 2002 cleat’s goal of precision through modern Phantom VNM technology to facilitate a powerful strike.Most notably, the new boot comes equipped with a Precision Pwr strike zone in theinstep —13 ridges set at specific angles and ascending heights to help keep the ball down and to provide a bite on its surface.The boot is the third release from the Nike Football’sFuture DNA Pack, which finds Nike’s current performance boots each paying homage to a classic Nike Football design, and follows the release of theNike Phantom VSN 2 Future DNA Hypervenomand theNike Mercurial Vapor Future DNA Mercurial.The Nike Phantom VNM Future DNA T90is available March 20 on nike.com.March 13, 2020 - The Nike Mercurial Vapor ""Future DNA Mercurial"" brings classic Nike Football design to one of the brand’s latest on-pitchinnovations.Originally released in 2009, the Nike Mercurial Vapor Superflywas the lightest,fastest iteration of theNike Mercurialat the time, and served as a glimpse into the future of Nike football boots.For the first time on a boot, the originalNike Mercurial Vapor Superflyincorporatednext-generation Nike Flywire technologyin a streamlined upper.

"Few shoes embody the toughness of late ’80s basketball design like Converse's ERX.Famously worn by several members of Detroit's rough-and-tumble, back-to-back title-winning team, the ERX also graced the feet of rock stars and skate legends. The wearers shared a hard-working, defiant spirit, and ERX became a beacon for the bold.First released in 1988, the ERX had an equal balance of bulk and tech. Underfoot, Converse's Energy Wave technology provided enhanced cushioning and spurred the Energy Return Multiplier (ERX) moniker. Thirty years later, the sneaker that epitomized the over-the-top basketball style of the late 1980s is born again, and with the help of streetwear designer Don C to reflect the bold attitude and style of basketball culture today.CONVERSE X JUST DON ERX

""We were taking Don C through the archives and when we got to the ERX, before we could even get into presenting it he goes, 'I remember that shoe, this is the shoe!' It spiraled into this rally cry to bring it back.""The Chicago-born designer recalled the shoe's championship pedigree — it capped a decade in which Converse athletes defined title-winning. More than that, Don C was reminded of the cross-cultural adoption it enjoyed. ""I remembered the ERX model because it had so many layers in the past,” he says. “That makes me proud, because I love when basketball becomes part of another arena.”Illustrator Benjamin Marra's interpretation of the Converse ERX 260 Animal, which evokesthe power and energy of '80s footwear ads.Skateboard graphics in Marra's rendering of the Converse ERX 260 reflect an era that merged basketball and skate.Reminiscent of early '90s metal-album artwork, this design alludes to the counter adoption of the ERX off the court.Bringing back the ERX gives the brand a unique opportunity to dig into its basketball history and carve out a future of creative rebellion as Converse reclaims its heritage in the sport. Says Manley, ""It allows us to have a different attitude, one that is authentic to Converse — a counterculture view to basketball and street style.""The Converse x Just Don ERX Hi arrives in White/Vaporous Grey/White this holiday season.

James has always strived to be more than just a basketball player. He has made an impact in the community by emphasizing education and using his powerful platform to empower those around him.Harlem's Fashion Row, the New York City-based fashion collective, was created in 2007 to showcase the work of multicultural designers, particularly from women who are impacting the community.The collaboration between James and Harlem's Fashion Row was natural: Take two voices devoted to empowering others and combine them to create a shoe that honors the strength of African American women everywhere. The result is the HFR x LeBron 16, the first LeBron signature shoe to be reimagined by female designers.Recognizing HFR’s mission to provide a space for fashion designers of color to build profitable businesses, Nike and LeBron James asked the fashion collective to transform the original concept of the LeBron 16. HFR founder Brandice Daniels selected three designers to tackle the project — Kimberly Goldson, Felisha Noel and Undra Celeste Duncan — based on their previous work and passion for sport.Meline Khatachourian, a Nike global basketball footwear designer, along with James’ longtime footwear designer Jason Petrie, worked together to lead the design process with HFR. The trio of HFR designers traveled to Nike World Headquarters to learn how a performance shoe was made before meeting back in New York City for a working design session.“The collaboration has led to a fusion of something that’s incredibly exciting — not just a shoe, but a message that’s inspiring to other women,” said Khatachourian.Noel, Celeste-Duncan and Goldson attend a design session at Nike World Headquarters, where they were mentored by Nike Basketball footwear designers Meline Khatachourian and Jason Petrie.Kimberly Goldson says the designers and James felt a kinship the moment that he described his vision for the shoe.“We each had something that connected the four of us based on what LeBron saw from his mom, and the sacrifices she made for him,” says Goldson. “My mom did it. LeBron’s mom did the same for him. The connectivity was there between all of us.”The HFR x LeBron 16 was unveiled at the Harlem's Fashion Row Showcase Gala on September 4, during which James was honored for his influence and contribution to the community. Although he’s watched many signature shoes evolve in his career, the sight of the HFR x LeBron 16 is deeply personal.“As someone who has a platform, because of what I do, I thought it was important to lend that platform to a group of people that I believe are under-recognized,” says James. ""Being the son, husband and father of strong African American women, I felt like this was something I wanted to do for them and for all the strong women out there who are succeeding despite what might be stacked against them.”In its cooperative creation, the HFR x LeBron 16 is a symbol of unified strength. The shoe was always driven by a mission greater than its individual parts — one focused on assisting others.The HFR x LeBron 16 is inspired by James' belief that ""African-American women are some of the strongest people on earth.""The HFR x LeBron 16 releases September 7 in limited quantities as an exclusive on SNKRS in North America and on nike.com."
"Almost a decade before the founding of seminal hardcore band Suicidal Tendencies, frontman Mike Muir received his first pair of Converse as a birthday gift.""I think I was 10, 11 or 12,"" he recalls, which putshis first wear in the mid-70s. He was immediately attracted to Chucksfor the purity of the shoe's character. ""It's one of those things that sells itself. You could identify with the shoeswhere we were from in California.""Far from being nostalgic, Muir views Converse's most enduring silhouette as perennially proper. ""A lot of people always talk about the good old days. My dad always said 'don't ever be like that,' because when you're talking about the old days,you are not in your time.""Suicidal Tendencies, from its '83 debut record to its latest, ""STill Cyco Punk After All These Years"" (releasingSeptember 7) has stayed in its time. Muir attributes this to clarity of purpose. More specifically, he notes that theirlongevity owes a lot to avoiding prevalent trends in favor of sticking to what they like.""Why do some things last?"" he asks, rhetorically. ""When you get into the collective, you try to fit in, and when you are the individual you really don't care. And then people tend to follow. That's what has served us. We've done what we've liked rather than follow what others like. Going back to the early '80s, almost 40 years, there's been so many different trends. But if you get on that bus you get off your road and end up being lost.""Part of this philosophystems fromthe establishment,early in the band's history, of a graphic identity that has become a pop culture standard. Envisioned by RicClayton, Venice-born artist and early member of No Mercy, the band's artwork, with its skulls and raw hand lettering, defined the group's singularity.This artwork forms the basis for Suicidal Tendencies' new collaborative collection with Converse. While born in the'80s, there's a timelessness that extends from the consistency Muir and the rest of the band present. ""We are very fortunate because we like where we are at and what we're doing,"" says Muir.""We don't have a bell bottom and shag carpet stage, whereas a lot of people did things they wish they didn't.""For Muir, the collaboration's highlightis the Chuck 70 HI, made with a vintage canvas upper adorned with an all-over digital print and Suicidal Tendencies leather patch. ""If someone had told me in my teens I'd have a shoe, I'd have said 'no way,'"" he says.""This would totally blow away that 16-year-old kid. That's a great thing.""The remaining portions of the collection — a Chuck 70 low and apparel featuring screen-printed artwork ranging from a woven poplin shirt to sweatshorts — all follow the band's long-standing aesthetic. After all, if it still works, why change it?The new Converse x Suicidal Tendencies collection releases September 7 on converse.com and at select retailers.An early release, in Converse’s hometown of Boston, will takeplace during a pop-up at Bodega that extends from September 6 (11am to 8pm) to September 7 (11am to 8pm), and coincides with aSuicidal Tendencies show at the House of Blues in Boston."
"The black Converse x Dr. Woo Chuck 70 reveals a Sunset Gold colorway over time.Brian Woo — better known as Dr. Woo, one of the most in-demand tattoo artists in the world — has a proud, individualistic personal style. He’s quick to mix high and low and wears favored items until they reach a perfect patina. In this, the Converse Chuck 70 is a favorite, so unsurprisingly the silhouette is the focus of the artist's second collaboration with Converse.Attempting to visually chart evolution, Woo has created a shoe that transforms through abrasion and friction. “The shoe is a culmination of all things that I love — vintage, the wearing in of your own clothes, how it keeps developing, transitioning, and how the Chuck, specifically, can stay in your life so long,” he says.Arriving in either black or white, the Chuck 70s reveal Sunset Gold and Green Absinthe colorways, respectively, over time.

"When Justin Timberlake began recording his fifth solo studio album “Man of the Woods,” he already had a special themed Air Jordan in mind. Following the popularity of the “Legends of the Summer” PE collection in 2013, Timberlake was ready to take it up a notch and design a colorway that would bring his album to life on his feet.As soon as the heartfelt tribute to his wife “Higher Higher” was created, Timberlake was already thinking of how to combine the ideas “Higher” and “Air.” “When we had the idea to make a product for every song, we knew making an Air Jordan would have to be what we did for ‘Higher Higher,’” saysTimberlake. The answer was an Air Jordan III, one of Timberlake’s all-time favorite sneakers.HIGHER is engraved on the medial upper of each shoe.Beyond being a touching love letter to his wife, “Higher Higher” also includes a universal message that Timberlake wants everyone to understand: “It’s really about the idea that no matter what we have in life, our relationships are the most important thing. Money, fame, success are all fleeting, whereas a real relationship will last for the long haul.”The left and right insole feature lyrics “FAME IS A LIE” and “STRESS IS CRUEL” respectively.Another relationship Timberlake holds close is the one he has with Jordan Brand. This close bond is what led to a conversation with legendary designer Tinker Hatfield. While Timberlake had already started concepting how to bring the project to life, Tinker had something else up his sleeve: the original AJIII sketch. The first version of this meeting of the minds debutedin front of millions during Timberlake’s half time performance at the big game lastFebruary. The “Two Minute Warning” AJIII JTH sold out instantly, leaving everyone wanting more from the man of the woods.Justin Timberlake's visit toNike World Campus to meet with Tinker Hatfield in January 2018.The “Air Higher” colorway delivers that by swapping out original materials to translate the theme of the album onto the iconic silhouette. “The album’s premise was really about making things in a handmade and artisanal way,"" says Timberlake.""The same way the album is filled with live instrumentation, we wanted the shoe to have the same feeling of being premium and made by hand.""The AJ3 JTH trades traditional leather for a smooth suede and adds leather laces.A 3M Swoosh is used as a nod to Timberlake’s stage presence under the bright lights.A custom box features photography from the album’s photoshoot at his home in Tennessee.The Air Jordan 3 JTH releases on August 28.

"When Anna Wintour gives herapproval for editorial or creative, she simply writes “AWOK,” which stands for “Anna Wintour Okay.” The Vogue editor-in-chief teamed up with Jordan Brand to put this approval stamp on two iconic silhouettes for the ultimate co-sign.The AJI Zip AWOK comes in University Red and Sail colorways. Its ultra-soft leather upper is accented by a bold metallic zipper and new embellishments, including a Swoosh. It comes with an “Edited by Vogue” Nike Air tag and the AWOK signature on the sole and tongue.Inspired by Anna’s signature suits and sunglasses, the AJIII SE AWOK features tweed as the primary upper material, and a back heel with the AWOK moniker.

"The LeBron James x John Elliott Icon QS allowed the duo to work on a silhouette from the ground up. Elliott describes the shoe as a ""breakthrough,” adding that the collaboration was ""a gift as a creative, and one you can only exercise through the Nike lens.""The collection is predicated on LeBron’s need for versatility, forming a wardbrobe of pieces that“can move and are transitional.”The LeBron James x John Elliott Nitrogen Pant features a subtle medial side zipper that opens up an interior gusset. ""You can open up into basically a straight leg,"" notes Elliott."

"April 23, 2018 - With a monochromatic upper and contrast stitching, the “Mono” introduces an unexpected approach considering the vibrancy of the initial GOLF le FLEUR* drops.The GOLF Le FLEUR* Mono collection comes in five premium suede hues: Black, White, Greener Pastures, Limoges and Rhubarb. It coincides with a complete apparel capsule of Converse Essentials Tees and French Terry Crew Sweatshirts available in Light Grey Heather, White, Green and Limoges.

Anunintended, but swiftly realized, product of those arresting designs was a versatile adoption by the era’s musical subcultures.Introduced in 1990, the Air Cross Trainer 3 Low extends aesthetic cues fromthe Air Trainer SC High. It was defined by a subtle upper color scheme, accented by pops of color on the tongue and midsole — a characteristic that remains in its 2020 version.

Even more enticing than its lightweight feel was its ability to stand out on the pitch: the cleat’s vibrant orange pop of color from the tongue, heel graphic, stud tips and laces created a stark contrast from the black premium leather upper (a signature of the Tiempo franchise). Nike Flywire technology was integrated into the leather for a midfoot lockdown and, overall, more dynamic fit, while enhanced vamp stitching was strategically placed for lateral agility.With tribute to itspredecessor, the latest Nike Tiempo Legend 8 gets OG Tiempo Legend IV Elite color treatment.Its fit and feel is defined by the Legend 8’s stitchless, quilted diamond pattern upper and Flyknit Fit Tunnel, providing a supportive and snug fit around the midfoot.Additionally, the boot has Quadfit mesh in the forefoot to prevent overstretch of theouter leather layer.The boot is the fourth and final release fromNike Football’sFuture DNA Pack, in which Nike’s current performance boots each pay homage to a classic Nike Football design, and follows the release of theNike Phantom VSN 2 Future DNA Hypervenom, theNike Mercurial Vapor Future DNA Mercurialand theNike Phantom VNM Future DNA T90.The NikeTiempoFuture DNATiempo Legendis available March 27 on nike.com.March 20, 2020 - The Nike Phantom VNM Future DNA T90brings classic Nike Football design to one of the brand’s latest on-pitchinnovations.Originally released in 2002, the Nike Air Zoom Total 90 IIwas the perfect blend of comfort, power and precision. Made of soft KN-100 —a strong, lightmaterial —the boot’s namesake stemmed from the creation of a cleat that would support player comfort for the total 90 minutes of a match. The cleat featured asymmetrical, off-center lacing for a larger boot-to-ball surface (which helps createa cleaner strike), as well as Zoom Air units in the outsole for optimal traction and stud pressure reduction.The Nike Phantom VNM Future DNA T90 paystribute to its predecessor’s classic black, white and red colorway, and translates the 2002 cleat’s goal of precision through modern Phantom VNM technology to facilitate a powerful strike.Most notably, the new boot comes equipped with a Precision Pwr strike zone in theinstep —13 ridges set at specific angles and ascending heights to help keep the ball down and to provide a bite on its surface.The boot is the third release from the Nike Football’sFuture DNA Pack, which finds Nike’s current performance boots each paying homage to a classic Nike Football design, and follows the release of theNike Phantom VSN 2 Future DNA Hypervenomand theNike Mercurial Vapor Future DNA Mercurial.The Nike Phantom VNM Future DNA T90is available March 20 on nike.com.March 13, 2020 - The Nike Mercurial Vapor ""Future DNA Mercurial"" brings classic Nike Football design to one of the brand’s latest on-pitchinnovations.Originally released in 2009, the Nike Mercurial Vapor Superflywas the lightest,fastest iteration of theNike Mercurialat the time, and served as a glimpse into the future of Nike football boots.For the first time on a boot, the originalNike Mercurial Vapor Superflyincorporatednext-generation Nike Flywire technologyin a streamlined upper. The purpose of the filamentand fibertechnology was to serveas a second skin, andoffera lightweight, stronger,more dynamic fit.

The shoe is really an emblem of this moment, a first in many regards.”Symbolizing women’s excellence on and off the court, the designer chose an updated approach to the Air Jordan OG SP x Melody Ehsani, and through a classic lens.

"Filip PagowskiPagowski's design for the Chicago Bulls makes the mascot look ""strong and powerful,"" he says.“I thought that it would go together nicely, this Irish idea mixed in with the idea of good luck and fortune,” says Pagowski of why he added four-leaf clovers to his design on the Boston Celtics.Pagowski went “old school” with his Cleveland Cavaliers design. “I used the coat of arms, the swords and the ribbon to tie in with representinga novel cavalier, like in the 18th century or something,” he says.Pagowski based his Oklahoma City Thunder design on the intense look of the thunder. “I wanted to show the power and explosiveness of the natural phenomenon and use that energy to represent the team,” he says.To portray the powerful character of the Golden State Warriors, Pagowski based the team’s design on the bridge that connects Oakland with San Francisco. “It’s a beautiful, powerful structure,” he says.For the Houston Rockets design, Pagowski turned to the city’s connection to space. “The rocket is very powerful and explosive, and that brings the feeling of the energy and speed,” he says.“The raptor is kind of like a dinosaur.So, I thought that two dinosaurs playing basketball seemed funny and kind of cartoonish,” says Pagowskiof his take on the Toronto Rapots, one of his most playful designs.Pagowski's trial sketches for the Bulls"

collaborationsMarch 04, 2018In 2017, Serena Williams solidified her status at as the greatest ever by winning the Australian Open while eight weeks pregnant.Throughout her career, the 23-time Major winner has used sport as a platform for progress. It’s no surprise that with Serena’s return to the court for her first tour-level match next week at Indian Wells, the tennis icon is using the moment to once again stand for equality.“I want people to understand there is no wrong way to be a woman. We shouldn’t be made to feel like we have to act a certain way because we are women and we shouldn’t be made to feel like we need to fit into the same box. We are all different and we should celebrate those differences,” says Serena.That thought is reflected in a new Nike film, ""Until We All Win,"" that recognizes International Women’s Day and features Serena.Nike has empowered women through sport for more than 40 years.

"“This is a universal icon item that everybody should have. They’re part of my daily uniform. I will wear them until they fall apart!” Anderson says. The deliberate nuance and refined features of the Chuck ‘70 allowed for designs that are at once feminine and masculine.“I wanted to make sure the shoe felt modern, but underline its timeless features,” he says.“It’s another functionality than the Chuck, and it’s very easy to wear,” Anderson notes of the heritage running sneaker. The blocked body was the perfect place to playfully experiment with unique color combinations and proportions.“We wanted to work on a product that could still read as a low Chuck ’70, but work on the details.A vintage ballerina that inspired it was actually more of a sport slipper in mesh,” explains Anderson. “I liked the functionality and lightness of that shoe, and we decided to adopt some details to reinterpret the icon.”The first drop from the highly anticipated Converse x JW Anderson collaboration, “GLITTER_GUTTER,” hits stores globally December 14.View the full lookbook here."

collaborationsSeptember 12, 2017Two anniversaries collide in the Air Max 97 OG / UNDFTD. The venerable retailer turned brand is 15, while Nike’s Air Max 97 is, of course, 20. In celebration, the two parties combine forces for an Air Max model that neatly ties together a shared, future-focused ethos.“The Air Max 97 is one of those pinnacle sneakers that changed everything when it came out. Nothing had looked like it at the time; the shape, lacing system and metallic silver gave it a more premium feel people hadn't really seen before. Upon its release it stopped everything, it screamed future,” says UNDFTD co-founder Eddie Cruz.For its collaboration, UNDFTD gives the Air Max 97 a luxury twist — not in material, but in direct ode to Italian fashion. Just as the shoe represents two anniversaries, the conceit works two times over. First, it pays homage to a nation that championed the silhouette from the start, and second it nods to the intersection of high and low that’s been staple of streetwear for generations.“Celebrating our 15th anniversary on the 20th anniversary of the Air Max 97 felt like a natural opportunity .Why not use a model that is not only respected by our organization but also spoke of the future in its time?” says Cruz. “The design embodies Undefeated. We offer an elevated aspirational life style. Something for people to aspire to, to be driven towards and when you have it, you want people to know it.“The Air Max 97 OG / UNDFTD releases in both black and white exclusively at UNDFTD on September 16. A global launch of the black colorway follows on September 21.

collaborationsAugust 23, 2017In celebration of the 20th anniversary of the Nike Air Max 97, six creatives, together representing Movement 97, explore the silhouette’s bold character through their own distinctlenses.Faye Webster, Halima Aden, Bryant Lui,Anajah Hamilton,Lucia Santina Ribisi andLauren Tepferwere each born in 1997, andrepresent a different mode of expression. Theirworks span various media(from textile to video)and practices (from architecture to photography), but unite here to react to three central themes relating to the AM97 Ultra:What you see is what you reinvent
When iconic design inspires infinite evolution
The revolution meets the road in the fastest fashionIn their respective responses, each honors the original vision of the Air Max 97 and finds opportunity to push new boundaries through exploration of the AM97 Ultra.“I like patterns and things that match, and with the Air Max 97, I got the idea from the shoe itself. A play on airand the futuristic inspirations of the shoe within a set that felt more like a galaxy. As for the pink shoe, I wanted to keep it monochromatic to really show off its color.”“There’s always room for improvement. My life philosophy is: If I did wellyesterday, I could do better today. Even with these shoes, Nike is not thinking for the customers today, they’re keeping in mind the customers 10 years from now, 20 years from now, 60 years from now. What is that brand going to be remembered for?”“The design of the shoe, with its iconic curvilinear lines and ripples, inspired the U-shape configuration of the building as well as its S-shapeprofile. The S and U shapes create indoor and outdoor zones, and I translated the curved stripes into the glowing handrails of the building. The gradient found on the shoe from silver to black were applied to the glazing of the building to lead the viewer’s attention toward the center of the space by replacing the silver thread with light.”“Moving in the sneakers feels graceful,so I wanted the video to look very gentle andcentered around movement. The pink Air Max 97 Ultras look angelic andsoft, and are appealing to the eye. The black 97 Ultras look powerful, strong and bold. I decided to mix both traits with gentle and strong dance movements, locations that complemented the shoe and roses inspired by the inside of the sneaker.”“I was bornthe year Nike released Air Max 97. This Air Max 97 Ultra inspires me to think about technology, our cyborg identitiesand how tools can give us access to a sense of freedom. #Movement97 is about using our tools to see a bigger pictureso that we can work towardunbounded access for everyone. We are creating through perpetual motion.”“The 90s are making a comeback in the most colorful way. With the leading lines, colors and patterns, I was inspired by the nostalgic vibe of the Air Max 97 Ultras paired with the colors and textures of suburbia. A mystical atmosphere of blue, orange, red and pink tones contrasted by the sneaker, provides a moment reminiscent of the past.”

Two more unreleased silhouettes, the Nike Zoom Fly SP and Nike React Hyperdunk 2017, were similarly stimulating in their newness and potential. Abloh was inspired by the cutting-edge cushioning innovations of Breaking2’s Nike Zoom Vaporfly Elite running shoe and basketball’s React Hyperdunk 2017, and decided to introduce an evolution of the reveal called “GHOSTING” using translucent uppers. With these five shoes, including basketball icons that preceded the Hyperdunk (the Converse Chuck Taylor and Nike Air Force 1 Low), and a running icon that preceded the Vaporfly Elite (the Nike Air Max 97), Abloh says he wanted to use a common, semi-revealing material to unite their combined 94-year history.“My high school years were made up of playing soccer, skateboarding and biking year-round,” says Abloh. “What I've learned from playing sports and also being obsessed with design is that there is an inherent style and focus that exists amongst athletes and designers alike: What propels them to be the best comes from deep within.”Nike will host“Nike Off Campus” events in New York City and Londonto celebrate The Ten through presentations of the full collection and exchanges about the ideas that inspired it. ""Nike Off Campus"" will take place in New York City from September 6 to 8 at 23 Wall Street and from September 14 to 17 at various locations in East London.The first five icons of The Ten — the Air Jordan I, Nike Blazer, Nike Air Presto, Nike Air Max 90 and Nike Air VaporMax — will be pre-released at NikeLab stores in New York City (Sept. 9-13), London (Sept. 18-22), Milan (Sept. 21-25) and Paris (Sept. 26-30).The full collection including all ten silhouettes will be available in November at NikeLab stores and select retailers worldwide."

The shirt and shorts are also constructed using a new knitting process that integrates single and double knit to enhance breathability, stretch and fit."
"The former innovation allows additional Air to be integrated into the unit while the latter allows for more extreme Air geometries that enable designers to place even more Air directly underfoot. Together, these capabilities wholly eliminate the need for a traditional foam midsole.By shedding the weight and bulk of a foam layer, the new midsole achieves greater flexibility and spring without compromising structure, while also reducing weight and waste. And by placing the upper directly on the VaporMax Air unit, a pillowy sensation and greater energy response are produced."

The newly launched series focuses in on the confident and daring spirit of youth, which has embodied the soul of Converse evangelists in the past, present and future.Converse’s Forever Chuck Scenes is formatted for digital consumption through platforms such as Instagram Stories, Snapchat and as online video content with the Chucks and LA Culture scene launching on February 17."

collaborationsJanuary 28, 2017Tennis legend McEnroe reflects onWilliams' unmatched play and legacy, following her history-making victory.Growing up in Compton, California, it’s not expected that you’re going to be the greatest tennis player who ever lived, one of the greatest — if not the greatest — athletes in the history of the sport. It’s a situation that comes along once every hundred years.Serena has had something special ever since I saw her at eight years old, [when] I hit a few balls with her and her sister. But I didn’t realize at the time that she’d be as great as she is. She has this will — more will than any other male or female player I’ve ever seen. Even though she has accomplished a lot, she wants more. That’s something that separates a champion from a truly great champion. She wasn’t satisfied when she got as many majors as her sister. She wasn’t satisfied when she caught up to [past champions] and she doesn’t seem satisfied now that she’s claimed the record for singles title in the Open Era. She wants to be considered the best ever.Even though she has accomplished a lot, she wants more. That’s something that separates a champion from a truly great champion.She’s the player who’s gotten out of more trouble, out of more match-point situations, out of more match-game situations; she’s in another gear, mentally. It’s hard to dig deep in your soul to find what it is that allows you to continue — to not only want it but to train for it and accept it. When that happens, people may treat you differently. They may resent it. They may have trouble accepting it, may not respect it, so you put yourself out on an island a little bit.Early in her career, she didn’t play a great deal of tournament tennis, and a lot of people around the sport thought that hurt her. Ironically, it ended up helping her play as long as she has, because there’s still mental freshness to her that has allowed her to maybe even improve in her 30s, which is extremely hard to do in tennis.She’s been able to find that comfort level, where she’s been able to excel and bring out the best in her tennis. There’s a lot that she’s been able to show younger players and there’s a lot to be learned from what she has done.

collaborationsJuly 15, 2015Para comemorar o 20º aniversário do Air Max 95, e explicar de forma criativa a inspiração por trás da criação docalçado,a Nike convidou osartistas Andy Van Dinh e Katie Scott para ilustrar tanto a silhueta original, quanto as mais novas versões do modelo, recém-lançadas esta semana.O objetivo era desenhar os calçados como se eles fossem feitos de carne e osso, seguindo o conceito criativo adotado por Sergio Lozano na década de 90, que se inspirou na anatomia do corpo humano para criar o Air Max 95. Não à toa, foram escolhidos pela Nike dois artistas conhecidos por seus trabalhos baseados na anatomia humana, e, portanto, capazes de traduzir de forma visual a ideia que inspirou o designer da Nike a criar um dos tênis mais populares do mundo.Andy Van Dinh desenhou o Air Max 95 original e Ultra Jacquard, enqaunto Katie Scott trabalhou no Air Max 95 Ultra, o modelo feminino. Há pouco tempo atrás, os dois se encontraram para refletir sobre o projeto, compartilhar seus sentimentos sobre o tênis, e falar o que mais os cativava no corpo humano.Andy Van Dinh - Eu sempre gostei de desenhar e fazer as coisas, mas eu não tinha conhecimento que isso poderia ser uma opção de carreira. Eu acabei estudando biologia e matemática durante os meus primeiros anos de faculdade. O plano original era ser médico, mas eu odiei medicina. Felizmente, eu escolhi uma aula de desenho como matéria optativa e, após a primeira aula, decidi mudar de curso. Foi quando eu comecei a levar a arte a sério e me dei conta de que queria fazer isso para sempre.Katie Scott - Quando criança sentia muita vontade de desenhar, e tive sorte o suficiente em manter esse desejo depois de adulta. Na escola você só pode realmente estudar Arte e Design Gráfico. Gosto de ambos, mas não era exatamente o que eu queria. Quando descobri o mundo da ilustração especificamente, eu finalmente me encontrei e soube que essa era a carreira que eu queria seguir.Andy Van Dinh - Ao isolar cada órgão, eu posso usar algo pequeno para representar uma ideia mais ampla. Cada órgão refere-se à totalidade do corpo, à natureza humana, ou a uma narrativa específica. É uma forma de dissecar e analisar o exterior por meio do interior. Ironicamente, eu personifico estes órgãos e transformo o interior no exterior, a fim de encontrar algo mais profundo por dentro. Eles são remanescentes de uma visão mais geral da humanidade.Katie Scott -Eu amo o detalhe, a simetria e a estrutura da anatomia. Também sou interessada na história do estudo anatômico e as voltas e reviravoltas em nossa compreensão do corpo. Sou fascinada pelas teorias imaginativas da Antiguidade, onde o corpo era cheio de bile e água, e os órgãos moviam-se livremente pelo torso. Muito do meu trabalho anatômico é baseado nesta visão fantástica do início da ciência.Andy Van Dinh -Normalmente, as minhas ideias surgem quando estou meio sonolento, enquanto meus pensamentos são meio delirantes e incoerentes. Eu procuro experimentar e trabalhar com ideias ambíguas até que elas façam sentido para mim. Grande parte da minha inspiração vem do processo de realmente fazer as coisas, descobrindo-as enquanto trabalho, e entendendo como cada parte interage com a outra.Katie Scott -Eu me inspiro no trabalho de alguns outros artistas como Ernst Haeckel, Cornelius de Witt, e Albertus Seba. Cada um deles tem formas muito diferentes e belas de capturar a natureza. Fora isso, eu diria que a botânica tem um forte poder sobre mim. Eu sempre me surpreendo pelo reino vegetal.Andy Van Dinh -Eu queria que o espectador compreendesse as camadas do tênis e as referências das partes do corpo. Eu também queria demonstrar como Sergio Lozano dissecou a anatomia humana para encontrar as texturas e as formas do tênis. No geral, eu pensei na ilustração como uma colagem coesa de partes do corpo, com cada camada sobrepondo-se e revelando o que está por baixo. Meus primeiro pensamento foi que eu não queria decepcionar o designer original, já que eu estava reinterpretando o trabalho de outra pessoa.Katie Scott -Eu fiquei tão feliz em receber um briefing que parecia que eu mesma tinha escrito. Esse é exatamente o tipo de projeto e assunto que me interessa. Eu amei aprender sobre o design de calçados também.O Nike Sportswear Air Max 95 Ultra Jacquard e o Air Max 95 Ultra feminino estarão disponíveis no nike.com, e em lojas selecionadas da Nike Sportswear, a partir de amanhã, 16 de julho.Nascido em Calgary, Alberta, o artista Andy Van Dinh se formou em artesna universidade de Calgary, no ano de 2012. Com foco, principalmente, no desenho e na pintura, ele é conhecido por sua relação com o conceito de anatômia humana e sua habilidade única de dar um significado profundo, além do superficial, às suas obras. Em agosto de 2015, Van Dinh começará seu mestrado na Faculdade Hunter, em Nova York.Depois de se formar em 2011 na universidade de Birghton, em Londres, a britânica Katie Scott estampou em vários lugares, inclusive jornais, seus desenhos a mão e suas ilustrações coloridas e digitais. Para discorrer sobre a importância do mundo natural e sua preocupação com ele, ela publicou um livro sobre o assunto intitulado Animalium, eleito em 2014 pelo Sunday Times o livro do ano para as crianças.

collaborationsJuly 08, 2015Em meados dos anos 90, a Nike buscava uma renovação na sua linha de tênis para corrida. O sucesso inicial durante as décadas de 70 e 80 estava perdendo espaço, na década de 90, para as novidades em basquete, e a revolucionária família Air Max ainda não havia atingido todo o seu potencial. Para mudar esse cenário, os líderes da categoria na empresa apostaram em um jovem designer, Sergio Lozano.O Air Max 95, criação de Lozano, sintetizava o significado da palavra ‘diferente’. Até então, nenhum tênis de corrida da Nike possuía construção e cores similares ao modelo, que inovou ao introduzir uma cápsula de Air visível na parte frontal do calçado. Em seu quarto ano na empresa, Lozano modificou o DNA de corrida da Nike ao instigar a imaginação de uma nova geração de designers e corredores com sua criação.Para celebrar o vigésimo aniversário do Air Max 95, e a coragem de Lozano ao apostar numa proposição tão arriscada na época, a Nike lança dois novos modelos: o Air Max 95 Ultra Jacquard e o Women’s Air Max 95 Ultra. Ambos foram projetados por designers que trabalharam a partir do modelo original, seguindo os mesmos passos criativos de Lozano, só que com novos métodos de fabricação. Tudo para manter a família Air Max tão inovadora quanto era quando surgiu, em 26 de março de 1987, honrando suas características criativas iniciais.Ben Yun, responsável pela criação do Air Max 95 Ultra Jacquard, e hoje um dos principais designers da Nike, ainda tem na ponta da língua a razão pela qual decidiu fazer parte da empresa anos atrás. Ele sempre viu a Nike como um lugar onde os designers tinham liberdade para criar sem nenhum tipo de obstáculo, como uma marca que acreditava que tudo era possível. E foi o design inovador de Lozano que o convenceu de que seu lugar era onde ele está até hoje, no Oregon. ""Eu aprendi a criar sapatos com um engenheiro de moldes, um tipo muito tradicional de sapataria. A forma como Sergio quebrou todas as regras me chocou e me inspirou"", recorda Yun.Após trabalhar em vários designs para o Air Max 95, Yun sabia que precisava recriar o tênis que o levou à Nike, mas desta vez de um jeito muito diferente de tudo que ele já tinha feito. ""A maioria das minhas versões de Air Max 95 envolvia inovações, mas sempre mantinham o design icônico do original, como o Air Max 95 Engineered Mesh. Para comemorar os vinte anos do modelo, não quis seguir esse caminho por isso, o Air Max 95 Ultra Jacquard é realmente diferente”.Do cabedal ao solado, o Ultra Jacquard é um exemplo de inovação.Para este projeto, Yun assumiu o papel de cientista maluco, criando um novo modelo a partir do DNA do Air Max 95. Ele se concentrou em um projeto com dinâmica mais leve e flexível. A sola de poliuretano original foi trocada por uma versão injetada de Phylon. O centro do novo material foi retirado, reduzindo o peso e aumentando a flexibilidade.Ultrapassando os limites da criação de Lozano, Yun utilizou o antigo processo de tecelagem Jacquard em uma única camada de tecido, criando um cabedal moderno que ainda sim representa o conceito inicial de anatomia proposto pela versão original do Air Max 95. Por fim, a segunda geração do Nike Flywire foi aplicada como uma opção para os elásticos originais de nylon. ""A fáscia humana é um tecido mole. A segunda geração do Nike Flywire é dinâmico e se move com o pé, pois ela o prende dentro do tênis. Você poderia dizer que eles são a combinação perfeita. ""O resultado final é uma versão surpreendentemente diferente e, ao mesmo tempo, atual, que atende às necessidades de um estilo de vida ativo, mas com a essência do Air Max 95 original.Como criador dos modelos Nike Roshe One, Air Max Thea e Air Max Ultra, o designer Dylan Raasch é referência quando o assunto é minimalismo. Para a versão do Air Max 95 feminino, que comemora o 20º aniversário do modelo original, o objetivo de Raasch foi apresentar um perfil mais baixo, com forma mais elegante.Isso significava mudar drasticamente uma das características principais do Air Max 95: o antepé com cápsula de Air visível. ""Era importante que ele se parecesse com o original, embora a cápsula de Air visível do antepé tenha sido removida"", diz Raasch.Inicialmente, o plano era mantê-la, no entanto, como o no Air Max 95 ela preenche todo o solado, o antepé teve de ser ajustado para um design atualizado. A exclusão elimina o material em excesso.A filosofia ‘menos é mais’ também se aplica ao cabedal. ""Ao usar películas sem costura, conseguimos obter os seis painéis em uma única camada sem sacrificar a gradação que é característica do modelo"", diz Raasch.Outra diferença ente este modelo e o original é a mudança no esquema de cores do tênis. Aqui, a gradação é inversa, começando com preto na parte superior, passando para tons mais claros até a parte inferior e terminando com o solado branco. Ironicamente, este esquema de cores foi uma das ideias apresentadas por Sergio Lozano, o designer do Air Max 95 original, enquanto ele pensava em usar novamente um solado preto.O Nike Air Max 95 Ultra Jacquard e o Nike Women’s Air Max 95 Ultra estarão disponíveis nike.com.br, bem como em lojas selecionadas, a partir de 16de julho.

collaborationsJuly 08, 2015In the mid ‘90s Nike Running needed a recharge. The category’s early success had waned and its game changing Air Max franchise had not yet reached full potential. To changethat the category leaders went all-in onyoung designerSergio Lozano,who against all odds proved to be worth the risk.His creation, the Air Max 95, epitomizes the word different. No Nike running shoe before it featured a similar construction, color choice and,here’s the kicker, forefoot visible air. In his fourth year at the company, Lozano changed the very DNA of Nike running and ignited the imaginations of a new generation of designers.To mark the twentieth anniversary of the Air Max 95,Nike celebrates with the release of two new models: The Air Max 95 Ultra Jacquard and the Women’s Air Max 95 Ultra. Both come from the hands of designers with strong connections to the original shoe and follow in the footsteps of Lozano by pioneering new methods of make.If you ask Nike designer Ben Yun what brought him to Nike the answer will be quick and without thought. Already a footwear designer, the Air Max 95’s design represented freedom of thought and expression. “I learned how to create shoes from a pattern engineer, a very old-school type of shoemaking. The way Sergio broke all the traditional rules amazed and inspired me,” Yun remembers. He looked at Nike as a place where designers were allowed to create without walls, a place where anything was possible. A year later Yun found himself in Oregon.Hardly his first Air Max 95 project, Yun found himself tasked to recreate the shoe that brought him to Nike, something very different than anything he had done with the silhouette previously. “Most of my other Air Max 95 models involved applying new innovations and keeping with the iconic design of the original, like the Air Max 95 Engineered Mesh. The Air max 95 Ultra Jacquard is the one that really pushes the envelope.”From upper to outsole the Ultra Jacquard is an exercise in refinement.Deviating from Lozano’s vision on the upper, Yun utilized the age-old Jacquard weaving process on the one-piece upper to deliver the updated anatomy story in a single layer of fabric. Lastly, second generation Nike Flywire was applied as an update to the originals nylon webbing eyestays. “Human fascia is soft tissue. The second-gen Nike Fywire is dynamic and moves with the foot as it secures it inside the shoe. You could say they are the perfect match.”The end result is a strikingly different yet familiar version of the Air Max 95 updated to fit the needs of an active lifestyle.As the creator of the Nike Roshe One, Air Max Thea, and Air Max Ultra tooling, Nike designer Dylan Raasch knows more than a little bit about minimalist design. For the women’s specific Air Max 95 to celebrate the original model’s 20th anniversary, Raasch’s aim was to serve up a lower profile with a sleeker last. That meant drastically changing one of the main characteristics the Air Max 95: forefoot visible air. “It was important that we made it look close to the original, even though we had to remove the forefoot Air-Sole unit,” Raasch says, explaining the painstaking process of keeping his new creation as true to the original as possible.Initially the plan was to keep the iconic dual Air-Soles. However, since the Air Max 95 Air-Soles only come in one size the forefoot had to be compromised in pursuit of the refreshed design direction. The exclusion eliminates excess material. A less is more philosophy also applies to the upper, “Using no-sew films we were able to get the six upper panels down to one layer without sacrificing the iconic gradation,” says Raasch.Further differentiation from the original comes from twisting the shoe’s color scheme. Here, the iconic gradation is reversed, beginning with black on the uppermost portion of the shoe and transitions to lighter shades moving downward. A clean white outsole finishes the look. Ironically this color scheme was one of the few ideas put forward by Sergio Lozano, the designer of the original Air Max 95, as he navigated the push back toward the use of a black outsole.Although the Women’s Air Max 95 Ultra looks similar to its forefather it is definitely cut from a different cloth, updated with innovations conceived to make everyday life a little more enjoyable.The Nike Sportswear Air Max 95 Ultra Jacquard and Women’s Air Max 95 Ultra will be available on nike.com/sportswear as well as select Nike Sportswear retailers beginning Jul. 16.

""There is boldness to the color that feels very true to the world of sportswear, yet it is a feminine, playful palette that feels authentic to sacai.”“It was exciting to work with the Windrunner as a key silhouette,” Abe continues. “This is one of Nike’s most classic designs. Through the design process of re-interpreting the garment, it’s unexpected to see it with a burst of feminine pleats at the back.”The new Windrunner Skirt re-imagines the iconic athletic jacket as a sleek front-snap skirt. A surprising pleated mesh underskirt creates volume and movement, elevating the piece from a sportswear staple to art in motion.Nike’s classic Dunk Lux basketball shoe receives an ultra-modern makeover featuring premium leather, an elasticized tongue and a drop-in Lunarlon sockliner for soft cushioning.

collaborationsMarch 26, 2015Paris-based artist Yué Wu doesn't stay still. Between traveling the world for inspiration, exhibitionsand projects, Wu rarely slows down long enough to reflect on how he's turned his passion into a profession. But even when his head is in the clouds, he maintains humility with his feet firmly grounded—and usually dressed in a pair of Air Max.""My first pair of Air Max that I bought for myself wasan Air Max 97,"" Wu explains. ""I went to the shop and they said, 'Okay you can have the shoe, either a size 8 or size 10.""Neither fit Wu, but that didn't deter him.""I was a size 9 at the time and I was like, ‘Whoa, okay. I'm probably going to grow. I'm going to have bigger feet.’ And I wore those, but they were way too big, and my feet never grew. But I was so proud.”Wu, an avid sneakerhead since that moment, no longer struggles to find his perfect size. On any given day, he can choose from his collection of 500-plus sneakers.""Normal people would say I have some disorder,"" he says. ""But it was never meant to be a collection. I just love sport shoes, I love colors andI love shapes.""For Wu, the appeal in Air Max mirrors what first drew him to drawing—it’s aboutself-expression.""I have very eclectic taste. As an illustrator and sneaker lover, there's really no one type of shoe that I like to draw,"" he says, describing the intersection of sketching and sneakers. ""But I'd love to draw my own shoe someday and design something different, something new.""In the meantime, Wu evokeshis passion for Air Max through illustration. To honor Air Max Day in 2015, he created an animated video highlighting 33 different Air Max models. The countdown ended with the Air Max Zero, which is now available at select Nike retailers and on nike.com.Air Max isn’t just a shoe—it’s a revolution. What started as a performance running solution in 1987 has since evolved into a currency for youth and self-expression. In the lead-up to Air Max Day, Nike will explore the passions of seven Air Max enthusiasts who, despite different latitudes, prove that the language of sneakers is universal.

collaborationsMarch 25, 2015Of all the positions in football, wide receivers often seem to have the best style. They match flash with finesse and grace with guts.Perhaps no player exemplified this bravado better last season than Odell BeckhamJr. The New York wide receiverearned offensive rookie of the year honors in a season highlighted by an acrobatic one-handed catch that proved the impossible is possible.But while BeckhamJr.’s hands get all of the recognition, it’s his feet that earn his attention.“I've been a sneakerhead since my feet could fit in some shoes,” BeckhamJr. says. “I remember in high school buying a lot of Nike sneakers and a lot of Air Max 1 shoes. I think I bought every Air Max 1 there was on the site just because it's such an easy shoe to wear. You can throw it on with anything.”For the Louisiana native, sneakers are a critical part of his everyday look. So when he had the opportunity to meet Las Vegas style leader Valerie Julian during a recent trip to the desert, BeckhamJr. didn’t hesitate.Julian is the co-owner of Fruition Las Vegas, a curated shopping destination. The store features an edited selection of apparel based in large part on Julian’s refined taste. She brought this expertise to her meeting with BeckhamJr.“I did my research, of course, and made sure that I brought items, colorways andprints that would speak to Odell and his personal style,” Julian says. “I made sure to balance minimal looks with extreme graphics and extreme bold prints. It was important to be able to have a well-curated selection that hit every type of aspect and facet that he might be into.”This meant putting outfits together from the Air Max up.“There's no better feeling than putting sneakers on and seeing that you’ve completed your outfit,” BeckhamJr. says. “You look down,you see what you've got on, and you just feel confident.”Julian agrees that confidence often stems from what one chooses to wear.“It's dressing the way that you want to be addressed,” Julian says. “I ask myself, ‘Do I want to be a little bit more bold in color, or do I want to be a little bit more minimal, and then my shoe is more of the pop piece?’ In all, though, it always has to make me feel confident in who I am and what I'm trying to convey to the world.”Julian and BeckhamJr. own more than 400 sneakers between them. With a passion for shoes as common ground, the two became fast friends.“I think it's such a beautiful way of expressing yourself, through shoes,” BeckhamJr. says. “It's a way to bond. You see somebody dressed up, they're swagged out. They're fly. And then you look at their feet, and they've got some fly shoes on. You like to dress like that, so you automatically have a connection.”Air Max isn’t just a shoe—it’s a revolution. What started as a performance running solution in 1987 has since evolved into a currency for youth and self-expression. In the lead-up to Air Max Day, Nike will explore the passions of seven Air Max enthusiasts who, despite different latitudes, prove that the language of sneakers is universal.

collaborationsMarch 25, 2015É muito fácil se perder em um lugar como Paris. Por sinal, é exatamente isso o que geralmente as pessoas mais gostam de fazer na capital francesa. Por isso, andar a pé por suas charmosas ruazinhas de pedra, onde durante a caminhada é sempre possível descobrir algo novo, está longe de ser um esforço para quem visita a cidade, pelo contrário. Paris esconde tesouros em cada um dos seus cantos, portanto, é preciso explorá-la. Atualmente uma dessas joias é David Luiz, brasileiro que assinou contrato com o Paris Saint-German no ano passado.“É muito legal viver aqui, uma cidade onde as pessoas são loucas por futebol”, conta David Luiz. “Estou feliz de ter esse apoio, de receber esse carinho da torcida. Paris não é só um lugar de casais apaixonados, mas também uma cidade que ama esporte”.Dentro de campo, o zagueiro se tornou sinônimo de segurança para o setor defensivo do clube francês, além de uma referência para uma nova geração de jogadores de futebol. Já fora dos gramados, David Luiz rapidamente tomou gosto por sua nova casa e aprendeu a admirar uma das capitais mais charmosas do mundo, apreciando lugares, sons e, principalmente, o seu estilo. Nos bastidores, o jogador ainda cultiva uma nova paixão: sneakers, com destaque para o modelo Air Max.“Os tênis sãoum símbolo de tudo que a vida me proporcionou até agora”, diz Luiz. “Hoje, felizmente, eu posso ter vários tênis, mas eu sei o quanto meus pais batalharam para dar pelo menos o básico para nós, eu e a minha irmã. Atualmente eu vejo que a vida me dá muito mais do que eu preciso. Sou grato por poder escolher qual modelo de tênis vou usar, e por ter a possibilidade de trocar caso eu não goste de um deles”.Outra figura ilustre da capital francesa que é apaixonada por tênis é o emblemático Kevin Duong, reconhecido justamente pelo conhecimento que tem sobre os mais variados tipos de calçados. O parisiense, inclusive, é a prova viva de que os próprios moradores de Paris optam por usar os pés na hora de explorar as peculiaridades da cidade. Da mesma forma que David Luiz, ele também vê o Air Max como a melhor opção para fazer isso.Essa paixão de Duong e Luiz pela capital francesa foi compartilhada recentemente. O encontro entre um apaixonado por calçados que é fanático por futebol, e um jogador profissional que ama os chamados sneakers aconteceu na La Ville Lumière, em Paris. Lá, os dois dividiram histórias sobre vitórias e derrotas, dentro de campo e nas lojas, interrompendo o papo somente para olhar um o tênis do outro.“O PSG tem me dado muitas alegrias”, explica Duong. “Não consigo me imaginar torcendo por outro clube”.“Dois tênis da coleção do Kevin são dedicados ao Paris Saint-Germain. Eu acho que ele tem muito bom gosto”, diz David Luiz com um sorriso no rosto.Aliás, um Air Max que Duong não terá tão cedo em sua coleção é um que Luiz gostaria de inventar.“Eles ainda não fizeram um de cabelo encaracolado, que iria me representar da melhor maneira possível”, brinca o jogador. “Ou se eles fizessem um com um sorriso, ou com uma língua pra fora. Mas, agora falando sério, os que melhor me representam são os mais coloridos”.Depois de se mudar para a capital francesa, David Luiz percebeu que a cultura de tênis em Paris é particularmente diferente da existente no Brasil.“No Brasil, os tênis são usados com uma roupa mais casual”, analisa o brasileiro. “Mas, aqui na França, eu vejo as pessoas usando eles com roupas mais formais”.Conhecedor nato da cultura sneaker parisiense, Duong é a pessoa mais apropriada para falar sobre essa tendência tão presente no dia a dia da cidade.“Em Paris, historicamente, pelo menos durante esse tempo que tenho vivido aqui, eu acho que é uma questão de paixão pelos tênis de corrida em geral”, explica ele. “Eu acho que, se você tivesse que escolher um modelo, seria o Air Max BW, que, em minha opinião, foi por muito tempo o tênis mais vendido na França”.De qualquer forma, independente do tipo, a questão é que o Air Max se tornou uma marca das ruas parisienses, não somente nos pés, mas também na forma de tópico de discussão para dois amigos como David Luiz e Kevin Duong.O Air Max não é apenas um tênis, ele representa uma revolução na indústria de calçados esportivos. Lançado como um tênis de corrida em 1987, o modelo transcendeu as pistas e conquistou as ruas, sendo visto nos pés de uma geração de jovens ávidos pela expressão de seu estilo e personalidade. No aquecimento para o Air Max Day, a Nike mostra a paixão de sete entusiastas do Air Max, incluindo o zagueiro David Luiz, provando que o gosto pelos chamados sneakers possui uma língua própria e universal.

collaborationsMarch 25, 2015Paris is a city easy to get lost in.For Kevin Duong, that’s just the way he likes it. The Parisian sneakerhead prefers to walk the city by foot, ideally in Air Max, uncovering hidden gems from one cobblestoned street to the next.Paris’ newest gem is David Luiz. The famous Brasilian footballer signed with Paris Saint-Germain last year. On the pitch, Luiz’s relentless defendinghas made him a safety net for club and country, as well as a flag-bearer for a new generation of football. Off the pitch, Luiz has quickly taken a liking to his new home, absorbing all the sights, sounds and sneakers.“It’s very cool, a city where French people are crazy about football,” Luiz says. “I’m happy to have this support too, to have this love involving the city. It’s not just the romantic couple in love, but the love for the sport.”This passion was flush on a recent spring day in Paris. Duong and Luiz crossed paths in La Ville Lumière in what became a summit involving a sneakerhead who loves football and a football player who loves sneakers.“PSG has been dear to me,” Duong explains. “I can’t imagine supporting another club.”The two traded stories of triumph and defeat, on the pitch and in the sneaker shop, only stopping momentarily to admire each other's footwear.“Two sneakers in [Kevin’s] collection are dedicated to Paris Saint-Germain,” Luiz says with a smile. “I think he has very good taste.”An Air Max that Duong doesn’t have is one that Luiz would be happy to invent.“They haven’t done one yet with curly hair, which would define me best,” Luiz says, laughing. “But in all seriousness, those with lively colors will better define who I am. Or if they make them with a smile, or with a tongue sticking out, that could be it.”The Paris Saint-Germain defender is well known for his unique hair and comedic personality. But what many may not know is that he is an avid fan of sneakers, especially Air Max.“The sneaker is a symbol for all that life has given me,” Luiz says. “It's possible today to have many sneakers. I know how much my parents have struggled to give us, my sister and me, at least the basic things. And today I see that life has given me even more, much more than I’ve ever asked for. I’m happy to be able to choose, 'Well, I’ll wear this one, no, it doesn’t look cool, I’ll change it.'”Luiz has noticed that sneaker culture in Paris is distinctly different from that in Brasil.“In Brasil, sneakers are paired with a much more casual look,” Luiz says. “But here in France, I see people wearing sneakers with more formal clothes.”As an expert on Parisian sneaker culture, Duong is able to expand on this thought.“In Paris, historically, at least while I’ve been living here, I think it’s really about a love affair with running shoes in general,” Duong says. “I think if you had to choose one model, it would be the Air Max BW, which, I think, for a long time used to be the highest-selling pair in France.”But no matter the silhouette, Air Max is a staple of the Parisian street, not just on foot, but also as a conversation-starter for two new friends.Air Max isn’t just a shoe—it’s a revolution. What started as a performance running solution in 1987 has since evolved into a currency for youth and self-expression. In the lead-up to Air Max Day, Nike will explore the passions of seven Air Max enthusiasts who, despite different latitudes, prove that the language of sneakers is universal.

collaborationsMarch 24, 2015Music and sport culture have always gone hand-in-hand, with artists famously describing the intersection with the following truism:We want to be them and they want to be us.Though worlds apart by profession, athletes and artists share an incomparable commitment to their passions. This notion, along with a common love for Air Max, brought Russian footballer Aleksandr Kokorin and rapper L'One together. A new friendship immediately blossomed.“Even before we met, I loved what he did,” Kokorin says.“And when I found out that he used to be an athlete, I understood that we had much more in common.”Much like Kokorin, L’One grew up in sports, playing basketball at the highest level in Russia. He approaches performing on the mic with the mindset of a top-tier athlete.“Sport is definitely a huge inspiration to me,” L’One explains. “Like sports, there is always some competition in music.”But L’One and Kokorin have bonded over much more than a shared desire to be the best.They stand at the forefront of Russian sneaker culture, with the next generation of sneakerheads eyeing every pair they wear.“Sneaker culture in rap in general is very visible and important,” L’One says. “Air Max is a must-have. I know a lot of Russian artists who wear them every chance they can get.”Air Max is a staple of Kokorin’s wardrobe as well. The rarer the model, the better.“The first time I saw Air Max, I instantly fell in love with them,” Kokorin says. “The most important thing for me is that nobody will have the same sneakers before me. It’s like a competition. I want to be the first.""For L’One, life without sneakers is unimaginable. But perhaps it would be simpler.“It’s funny. I always have the same problem when I travel abroad,” L’One says. “I know that I will buy a few new pairs, but that I will also take a couple of shoes with me. So every time returning to Moscow with a lot of sneakers is a journey by itself.”A journey to be sure. But as any sneakerhead will attest, it’s certainly one worth taking.Air Max isn’t just a shoe—it’s a revolution. What started as a performance running solution in 1987 has since evolved into a currency for youth and self-expression. In the lead-up to Air Max Day, Nike will explore the passions of seven Air Max enthusiasts who, despite different latitudes, prove that the language of sneakers is universal.

collaborationsMarch 23, 2015For years, Shiho Nakamura has surrounded herself with shoeboxes.“I keep my sneakers in their boxes,” says Shiho, a shoekeeper for one of Tokyo’s most influential sneaker boutiques. “I feel each box is like a photo, and when I browse through all of those boxes, I feel like I’m browsing through my own photo album.”A photo permanently stores memories. For Shiho, sneakers do the same.“While I have different memories attached to each of my sneakers, those memories may affect my decision for the day, and eventually the style of that day,” Shihosays. “So if I’m planning to meet someone, I may want to wear the same shoe associated with a special memory with that person.”The Air Max 95 is one particular shoe that elicits strong memories.“When I saw the Air Max 95 for the first time, I was so shocked,” Shiho says. “The design was so crazy and unlike any sneaker that I had seen before. It was the shoe that introduced me to sneaker culture. And I’d say that for the first time, the sneaker gave me culture shock.”Shiho’s ever-expanding photo library paints a unique story of how Japan’s sneaker culture has evolved, especially through a women’s lens.“In the past, it was not always the case but—” she says, momentarily pausing. “I feel that now girls are finally enjoying wearing sneakers. It’s become part of their lifestyle.”Shiho partly attributes this shift to the fact that women see sneakers as fashionable. But there’s another, perhaps bigger, factor.“Sports, such as yoga, have become a part of our lifestyle,” Shiho says. “People are having more fun playing sports or living a more active lifestyle. And sports can be the primary reason that people get to knowsneakers for the first time.”This isn’t just an observation. Shiho is learning this first-hand on the streets of Tokyo.“Sneakers are a communication tool for me, which makes it easier tobreak the ice,” Shiho reveals. “I often get asked, ‘What is that shoe?,’ or, “How can I find good sneakers?’ from other girls when they see me in them.”Armed with a camera and a deep appreciation for Air Max, Shiho is more drawn to embodying this blossoming culture than ever before.“When I wear my favorite one, I am filled with a sense of pride and satisfaction. I feel like I’m dreaming. They make my day happy.”Air Max isn’t just a shoe—it’s a revolution. What started as a performance running solution in 1987 has since evolved into a currency for youth and self-expression.

collaborationsMarch 23, 2015For English footballer Kyle Walker, home is where the heart is. It’s also where he stores his ever-expanding sneaker collection.“I've always had a trainer fetish. That's just my thing,” Walker admits. “I think I caught it from my mum.”This type of deep-rooted appreciation paved the way for an early childhood obsession with footwear. In his hometown of Sheffield, he did whatever he could to keep a fresh pair on hand. Of particular interest to Walker was the Air Max 90, a shoe that introduced him to the world of visible Nike Air.“Everyone used to try and get the latest color,” Walker says. “I can remember I used to go to my friends'house, knock on their door and say to them, ‘Can I borrow your trainers?’ I didn't want to ruin mine.”In his impressive sneaker closet, Walker stores a number of baby wipes in a cupboard. After he wears a sneaker, the defender wipes it down to return it to its near-pristine condition.“It's not a sob story or anything,” Walker says. “But when I was growing up, I didn't have much. So my mum always said, ‘Treat things with respect, and they'll last a little bit longer.’ So that's what I've tried to do.”His transition from small-town hero to big-city star has come with a bit of a sneaker transformation. While the Air Max 90 is still his crème de la crème, living in England’s major metropolis has inspired a more daring approach to footwear.“Coming from Sheffield and moving down to London at the age of 19, I found (trainer culture) a lot bigger down here and the trainers a lot louder,” Walker says. “You see all different varieties and the different ways people rock them. So I’ve taken a liking to some of these bolder styles.”For Walker, Air Max is more than just a statement about one’s style. It’s a footwear flag for one’s country.“As they say, the Air Max is a London trainer. So I feel that being from England, I have to keep repping the Air Max.”Air Max isn’t just a shoe—it’s a revolution. What started as a performance running solution in 1987 has since evolved into a currency for youth and self-expression.

collaborationsMarch 20, 2015What is zero? Mathematically, it’s nothing; a number created to represent the lack thereof.But at Nike, zero is something. It represents the beginning, the initial thought, the stroke of genius from which great things are forged.In this regard, zero adds up to the Nike Air Max Zero, an idea put on paper 29 years ago that contained nearly three decades of innovation. It wouldn’t become the first Nike Air Max, but without it, the Nike Air Max 1 would not exist.The Nike Air Max Zero was the first step. The one before the 1.“There was no brief or research, just a single revelation. I thought, ‘Why couldn’t we design an exciting new running shoe that reveals to the world what Nike Air really is?’” — Tinker HatfieldAt the time, Nike had already introduced Nike Air, which was a big hit among running enthusiasts. But Hatfield knew that wasn’t enough. The sensation of air underfoot needed to be expanded to other senses.“I remember thinking about how we were making bigger and bigger Air-Sole units and that people needed to see and understand them,” Hatfield recalls.Nike had the technology. What it needed was the perfect package to reveal it to the world. So Hatfield put pen to paper to do just that.What happened next is history: Hatfield famously travels to Paris, where he sees the Centre Pompidou and is inspired by the building’s unique inside-out design. Upon returning to Oregon, he sits down and brings the concept of visible air to life in the form of a revolutionary running shoe.This is the story that most know – but it is only half true. The Nike Air Max 1 wasn’t designed in one shot. Rather, it was the result of several design iterations, one of the earliest being the concept of the Air Max Zero. Unknowingly channeling designs that would not come to fruition until many years later, Hatfield focused on a shoe that featured only the necessities for supreme comfort and performance.“I thought about sculpting the midsole to be more minimal, rising up where more support is needed and dropping back down where it isn’t,""Hatfield remembers.He designed the upper to be comfortable and form-fitting, with a tipless vamp, an idea borrowed from the 1985 Nike Sock Racer. The sketch also featured an external heel strap that lacked a heel counter, a design concept that remained unseen until the Nike Air Huarache release in 1991.""It was pre-Huarache. Kind of like how sandals are designed to wrap around your heel, over your heel bone,"" Hatfield recalls about his original design.Put short, Hatfield had designed a shoe so advanced it could not be produced.“In many ways, it was ahead of its time,” Hatfield says. “Not just in regards to its appearance, but also in terms of the construction it required. The technology and materials available to us at the time weren’t advanced enough to execute the original vision.”Faced with reality, Hatfield was forced to reinterpret his design. This led to the creation of the Nike Air Max 1, which singlehandedly kickstarted a revolution in the running shoe industry. Visible air would soon make its way from running to basketball. Over time, Nike Air Max would transcend its running roots to become a lifestyle staple recognized around the world.Lost in the excitement was the Air Max Zero, a mere footnote to the Air Max phenomenon. But that would fortuitously change during a visit to the Department of Nike Archives, where the sketch sat forgotten for 29 years. Then one day the Nike Sportswear design team stumbled across an interesting drawing while searching for inspirations to celebrate the impending second annual Air Max Day.“There was an Air Max retrospective on display, complete with early prototypes and samples that had never seen the light of day,” says Graeme McMillan, the Nike designer tasked with bringing the Air Max Zero to life. “It was like an archaeological dig in terms of the items you don’t usually get to see unless you work there.”Once the team figured out the origin of the sketch, they knew what needed to be done.“The sketch was something that was never fully realized,"" McMillan recollects. ""We thought it would be great if we could share this with the world and shed some light on the development of the franchise.”Almost ironically, McMillan’s first impression of Hatfield’s sketch summed it up perfectly.“I thought it looked like a more contemporary version of the Air Max 1,” McMillan says.He immediately noticed the Huarache and Sock Racer cues in the inner sleeve and the untraditional tip. He also felt the pressure mount as he realized he needed to reinterpret an archival Hatfield sketch and bring it to life.“There is a responsibility to do the design justice in a way that is faithful to the design intent, but also to add another element of innovation to it by building the shoe in a way we couldn’t have back in 1987 when the Air Max 1 was released,"" McMillan states.To get started, the two design minds met, with Hatfield giving McMillan a full download. Hatfield emphasized his original design intent to achieve supreme comfort.To bring the sketch into the future and accomplish Hatfield’s goal, McMillan upped the ante by adding the latest Nike innovations. These included technologies such as the newly-introduced Air Max 1 Ultra outsole seen on the Air Max 1 Ultra Moire, with its cored-out Phylon construction, fuse uppers that reduce bulk without sacrificing support, and monofilament yarn mesh that helped build the unusual tip without sacrificing breathability. With that, Hatfield’s original concept was realized. The one before the 1 was ready to take it's first steps.“I love it. It features modern materials and construction methods, and I think that’s the only way to do it. That was then, this is now. If you handed me the project, I would have chosen new materials similar to what the team has done here.” — Tinker HatfieldThe Air Max Zero will be available for preorder onnike.com/sportswearin select marketson March22.It will be available at select Nike Sportswear retailers and onnike.com/sportswearon Air Max Day (March26).To further celebrate the launch of the one before the 1 and the revolutionary Air Max family, Nike caught up with some of the brand’s top athletes, including Andrea Pirlo, Serena Williams, Colin Kaepernick, Ayumi Hirano, Blaise Matuidi, Skylar Diggins, David Luiz, Gerard Pique, Grigor Dimitrov, Jerome and Kevin-Prince Boateng, Danny Care, Kevin Volland, Juan Martin Hernandez, Liu Xiang, Mario Goetze, Neymar Jr., Ona Carbonell, Francois Hougaard, Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer, Sanya Richards-Ross, and Sergio Ramos.

collaborationsMarch 20, 2015O que é zero? Do ponto de vista matemático, nada, um número criado para representar a ausência. Para a Nike, porém, ele representa o começo, a ideia inicial que conduz à criação de grandes invenções.Assim, o zero se transforma no Air Max Zero – um conceito colocado no papel há 29 anos que resultou em quase três décadas de inovações. Aquele não foi o primeiro Nike Air Max. Sem ele, entretanto, o Nike Air Max 1 não teria existido.O Nike Air Max Zero foi o primeiro passo. “Não houve briefing, não houve pesquisa. Houve uma única revelação”, lembra Tinker Hatfield, lendário designer de tênis da Nike, falando sobre os primeiros esboços da cápsula de Air visível. “Pensei: ‘por que não desenhar um tênis de corrida novo, bacana, que revelasse ao mundo o que de fato era o Nike Air?’”Na época, a tecnologia Nike Air já havia sido apresentada ao público, e fazia grande sucesso entre os amantes da corrida. Mas Hatfield sabia que aquilo não bastava. Era preciso expandir a ideia de ter ar sob os pés.“Eu me lembro de ter pensado que estávamos construindo cápsulas de Air cada vez maiores; lembro de achar que as pessoas precisavam ver e entender a ideia”, diz ele.A Nike tinha a tecnologia, mas era preciso encontrar a embalagem perfeita para mostrá-la ao mundo. Hatfield pegou o papel e a caneta e foi fazer exatamente isso.O que ocorreu depois é história, certo? Hatfield foi a Paris, onde viu o Centro Pompidou, e se sentiu inspirado pelo desenho sem igual do edifício, que parece uma construção virada pelo avesso. Ao voltar para Oregon, ele se sentou diante da prancheta e deu vida ao conceito do Air visível, na forma de um tênis de corrida inovador.Essa é a história que a maioria das pessoas conhece, mas as coisas não aconteceram bem assim. O Nike Air Max 1 não foi desenhado num tiro só. Ele foi resultado de várias tentativas e erros, das quais uma das primeiras foi o conceito do Air Max Zero. Inconscientemente, Hatfield partiu de designs que só ganhariam formas concretas anos depois. Ele centrou esforços na criação de um tênis que tivesse o necessário para garantir o máximo conforto e um melhor desempenho.“Pensei em esculpir a sola intermediária para deixá-la mais minimalista, elevada onde fosse necessário garantir suporte e mais baixa nas outras áreas”, lembra o designer.O cabedal foi desenhado com o objetivo de ser confortável e ajustado ao formato do pé – sem biqueira, numa ideia tirada do Nike Sock Racer, lançado em 1985. O esboço também trazia uma tira externa no calcanhar, sem apoio, em um conceito de design que só seria concretizado no Nike Air Huarache, apresentado em 1991.“Aquilo foi anterior ao Huarache. É mais ou menos como desenhar uma sandália que tem uma tira de couro em cima do osso do calcanhar”, recorda Hatfield.Resumindo: Hatfield desenhou um tênis tão avançado que, naquele momento, não podia ser produzido.“Em muitas formas, o modelo estava à frente de seu tempo”, diz ele. “Não apenas por causa da aparência, mas também pela estrutura. A tecnologia e os materiais disponíveis na época não eram avançados o bastante para executar aquela visão original”.Diante dessa realidade, Hatfield se viu forçado a reinterpretar o primeiro desenho. Isso levou à criação do Air Max 1, que acabou sendo o início de uma revolução na indústria dos tênis de corrida. A bolsa de Air visível logo avançou da corrida para o basquete. Com o tempo, o Nike Air Max ultrapassou as fronteiras do esporte e se transformou num produto essencial de lifestyle, reconhecido em todo o planeta.O Air Max Zero ficou perdido durante quase 30 anos em meio a constante evolução da Família Air Max. Mas durante uma pesquisa em busca de fontes de inspiração para comemorar o Air Max Day, a equipe de design da Nike Sportswear encontrou o esboço de Hatfield e o achou interessante.“Estava havendo uma exposição da retrospectiva do Air Max, com os primeiros protótipos e amostras que nunca tinham chegado a ser produzidos”, conta Graeme McMillan, designer da Nike encarregado de tirar o Air Max Zero do papel. “Foi como uma escavação arqueológica. Ali estavam peças que só podem ser vistas por quem trabalha lá dentro”.Quando a equipe descobriu a origem do esboço, decidiu na hora o que deveria ser feito.“O esboço nunca chegou a ser totalmente concretizado”, continua McMillan. “Pensamos que seria muito legal dividir aquela ideia com o mundo e contar a história por trás do desenvolvimento dessa família de produtos”.A primeira impressão que McMillan teve sobre o desenho de Hatfield foi uma definição perfeita para o esboço original.“Parecia uma versão contemporânea do Air Max 1”, explica.McMillan notou imediatamente as referências ao Huarache e ao Sock Racer no forro interno e na tira ao redor do calcanhar, que fugia aos padrões tradicionais. Ele logo começou a sentir a pressão com a qual teria que lidar: agora, cabia a ele reinterpretar o desenho de Hatfield, para que o modelo finalmente pudesse ser produzido.“É uma grande responsabilidade fazer jus ao primeiro desenho de modo que ele seja fiel ao original e, ao mesmo tempo, acrescente um elemento de inovação que permita construir o tênis de uma forma que teria sido impossível em 1987, quando o Air Max 1 foi lançado”, completa McMillan.Para dar início ao trabalho, os dois designers se reuniram, e Hatfield transmitiu todas as informações a McMillan. Ele ressaltou que o objetivo do projeto original era oferecer o máximo de conforto.Para transportar o antigo esboço rumo ao futuro e concretizar o propósito de Hatfield, McMillan decidiu apostar na decisão de acrescentar as mais recentes inovações da Nike ao projeto. Entre elas estão tecnologias como o solado Air Max 1 Ultra, apresentada recentemente e utilizada no Air Max 1 Ultra Moire, com uma estrutura oca de Phylon. E também os cabedais que reduzem o volume sem abrir mão da sustentação, além da malha de monofilamento que ajuda a construir uma ponta fora do comum, sem prejudicar a circulação de ar. Assim, o conceito original de Hatfield tomou forma – e o Air Max anterior ao Air Max ganhou vida.“Adorei”, afirma Hatfield. “O tênis usa materiais e estrutura modernos. Acho que essa é a única maneira de fazer esse modelo. Não estamos mais no passado, as coisas mudam. Se tivessem me dado o projeto agora, eu também teria escolhido novos materiais”.O Air Max Zero estará disponível para pré-venda por 24 horas a partir da meia noitedo dia 22 de março pelo nike.com/sportswear. A partir do dia 26de março, data do Air Max Day, o modelo poderá ser adquirido normalmente com exclusividade também no nike.com/sportswear.

collaborationsMarch 16, 2015A família Air Max faz parte da cultura de várias gerações. Além do Air Max 1, que no final dos anos 80 deu início a uma revolução na indústria dos calçados esportivos, outras versões do modelo também ganharam vida própria, influenciando de maneira única milhões de pessoas ao redor do mundo. Nenhuma delas jamais será esquecida, mas algumas, graças às seus designs e cores, e ao seu papel fundamental na evolução do conceito de tecnologia aparente, acabaram se destacando mais do que outras. À medida que a contagem regressiva para a segunda celebração anual do Air Max Day continua, a Nike resgata o passado para relembrar os ícones da família Air Max.A inovação nem sempre é visível, mas quando ela é seu impacto é grandioso. Em 1987, a Nike lançou o Nike Air Max 1, o primeiro calçado a colocar toda a sua inovação em plena exibição. Criada para promover amortecimento, a tecnologia Nike Air se tornou uma janela de oportunidades para as pessoas expressarem seu estilo e alcançarem omáximo desempenho. O Nike Air Max 1 chegou para desafiar e revolucionar a indústria de calçados. Após a sua criação, ela nunca mais foi a mesma.Tinker Hatfield foi o principal designer a dar vida ao Air Max. Porém, a tecnologiaNike Air não era maisvista comouma novidade na época, uma vez que ela já havia sidointroduzida no final de 1978 com o Nike Air Tailwind. Naquela ocasião,a cápsula de Air ainda estava efetivamente oculta na espuma.Entretanto, Hatfield, um arquiteto formado com um talento especial, usou a ousada arquitetura de Paris como fonte de inspiração para cortar a entressola de espumaedar visibilidade a uma tecnologia antes invisível.“Eu fui especificamente a Paris para ver a cidade, mas também para visitar o Centro Pompidou”, afirma Hatfield. “Trata-se de um edifício virado do avesso, com uma pele de vidro por baixo. Voltando a Oregon, tive reuniões com os técnicos que trabalhavam em cápsulas de Air maiores e transmiti minhas ideias. Pensei: talvez possamos também expor essa tecnologia e criar um calçado inigualável.”Na época, essa foi considerada por muitos uma ideia estranha, mas Tinker e sua equipe não desistiram. Para se destacar mais do que ostênis da época e transmitir uma mensagem de visibilidade, a lateral do calçado recebeuuma cor ousada que chamava aindamais atenção.A família Air Max evoluiu ao longo dos últimos 28 anos, com centenas de mudanças. Mas, cada modelo deve a sua existência, em parte, ao transcendente Nike Air Max 1.O Nike Air Max 90 é um tênis que se destaca por si só.Lançado em 1990,o terceiro modelo da família Air Max contavacom um volume maior de Nike Air doque seus antecessores. Entretanto, sua estética fluida era o que mais chamava atenção.O designer Tinker Hatfield sabia que a silhueta teria um impacto imediato, de modo que o design do tênis se baseava nessa ideia. O ângulo dos painéis e o bloco de cores foram o ponto de partida para aqueles que buscavaminspiração para garanto o máximo em desempenho.O Air Max 90 também incluiu painéis de plástico com nervuras e múltiplas opções de cadarço para criar o ajuste ideal, e a cor foi outro ingrediente essencial. O vermelho radiante do calçado, que mais tarde ficou conhecido como infravermelho, destacavao Air visível. Essa tonalidade específica e seu formato único marcaram o Air Max 90.Popular desde o início, o Air Max 90 garantiu que o modelo Air Max nunca perderia a sua qualidade. Ele simbolizou uma nova década com a sua forma, visual e cores. O tênis seria atualizado e remixado nos anos que se seguiram, mas permaneceriapara sempre cobiçado e essencial.O Nike Air Max 180 nasceu das mentes coletivas de Tinker Hatfield e do designer do Air Force 1, Bruce Kilgore. Os dois se reuniram para fazer a unidade Max Air visível tanto na sola quanto na entressola, destacando os 180 graus de amortecimento do calçado. Além da sua estética inteiramente nova, a cápsula de Max Air era 50% maior que a dos designs anteriores.A parte superior contou com uma manga interna dinâmica, que se estendia para se ajustar ao formato do pé, enquanto o calcanhar moldado fornecia apoio. As fendas flex em V na parte frontal do péforam outro experimento em movimento natural.O Air do calçado tornou-se visível em todo o mundo. Assim como o Air Max 1 foi liderado por um comercial memorável, o visual criativo do Air Max 180 foi apoiado por anúncios criados com cartunistas lendários, mestres dos efeitos especiais e diretores de cinema.O conceito de visibilidade foi opropulsor do Air Max 93. Como chocar um público já surpreendido tantas vezes? A cápsula do calcanhar sempre tinha sido o ponto focal, então por que não levá-la ao seu limite? A última criação de Tinker Hatfield foi construída com base nas fendas flex do Air Max 90 e usou uma manga interna dinâmica, feita de neoprene, para fornecer um suporte adicional ao pé e ao tornozelo.Em seguida, houve a grande e desafiadora questão dos 270 graus de Air visível. A cápsula de Air moldada precisamente – inspirada nas garrafas plásticas de leite– criou padrões completamente novos de amortecimento e se tornou a fundação para o ar visível na parte dianteira do pé.O Nike Air Max 95foium calçado que se destacou por ser diferente dos demais.Lançada em 1995, a ousada silhueta foi a primeira a exibir o Nike Air visível na parte frontal do pé. Esta abordagem completamente nova para o amortecimento proporcionou cápsulas duplas de Air, promovendo maior conforto e apoio aocorredor. Literalmente a ovelha negra da família, o Air Max 95 foi o primeiro modelo Air Max a incluir uma entressola em preto, traço que foi uma mudança drástica do design tradicional do tênis.Esta explosão de Air foi a característica definidora de uma silhueta inspirada no corpo humano. A entressola baseou-se na coluna, agindo literalmente como a espinha dorsal do design. Já os ilhós de nylon representavam as costelas, enquanto os painéis feitos em camadas de malha simbolizavam as fibras musculares e a carne.A abordagem para a parte superior, começando com uma base mais escura, tinha como objetivo ajudar o calçado a permanecer limpo, mesmo quando usado para corridas em estradas de terra. O swoosh quase transparente e um novo tipo de tipografia também foram as principais características deste modelo e, como ocorreu com o Nike Air Max 1 e o Nike Air Max 90, uma cor notável marcante destacou a cápsula de Air— desta vez posicionada do lado de dentro.O Air Max 95 abriu a porta da frente em termos de design e provocou um movimento global. De Nova Iorque a Tóquio, uma geração inteira desejava ter o futuro em seus pés. Mesmo depois de várias outras versões terem sido lançadas, ele ainda chama a atenção hoje em dia.Como se tivesse sido desafiado pelo design do Air Max 95, o Nike Air Max 97 respondeu fornecendo a primeira cápsula completa de Max Air. Evidentemente, algo tão inovador precisava de uma parte superior que fosse à altura de uma inovação tão audaciosa. Começando com a prata, o design fluido buscou inspiração nos trens-bala de Tóquio, enquanto a tubagem refletiva deu ao Air Max 97 um visual que era intensificado com a iluminação certa. O calçado ideal para um período em que se buscava cada vez mais força na música, filmes e estilo, ele se tornou desde então um clássico do design e definiu a sua época.Uma parte superior minimizada, combinada com um amortecimento máximo, defineo Air Max 2003. A nova silhueta fez uso da mesma cápsula de Air do Air Max 97. Porém, novos desenvolvimentos na moldagem, construção e amortecimento trouxeram o pé para mais perto do chão, oferecendo flexibilidade extra. O Air Max 2003 trocou a cor ousada dos modelos Nike Air Max anteriores para uma opção que deu ao calçado uma nova estética para os anos 2000.A parte superior foi feita com um material de desempenho chamado Teijin, semelhante ao utilizado em sapatilhas de atletismo e chuteiras. Isso deu ao calçado um visual leve e agressivo, além de um toque sofisticado, tornando-o extremamente confortável logo de cara.Quase vinteanos após o lançamento do Air Max original, a missão de fazer os usuários andarem “no ar” foi cumprida com o Air Max 360. Um tipo completamente novo de cápsula Max Air foi projetado, oferecendo maior estabilidade e amortecimento. As camadas de espuma que separavam o pé do cápsuladeram espaço, pela primeira vez, à construção termo-moldada, para fornecer 360 graus de amortecimento.Uma homenagem à paleta original do Air Max destacou o mais recente avanço, enquanto o efeito gradual de corte a laser na parte superior retomou o design do Air Max 95. O pacote exclusivo aplicou algumas partes icônicas do Air Max a esta nova sola. Longe do fim, o mais leve Air Max até então criou o modelo para uma nova onda de Air visível.O Air Max 2015 é um modelo que simboliza só a reinvenção, mas também arevolução. O tênis, próprio para corrida, possui uma parte superior que corresponde ao movimento dinâmico do amortecimento flexível e ultra confortável do Max Air, que estreou em 2013. O primeiro Air Max com uma malha respirável, ​leve, e quase sem costuras opera em conjunto com a tecnologia Flywire para envolver o pé. Ao empregar uma textura leve, que utiliza uma construção tubular e fendas flex de última geração, o tênis ajuda a suavizar o impacto da corrida. Mesmo o Swoosh reverso subverte a familiaridade e indica uma nova geração de expressão.

collaborationsMarch 16, 2015The Air Max family spans numerous generations. With the Air Max 1 leading the charge, the family's various iterations have taken on personalities of their own. None will be forgotten but some have come to stand apart, becoming known for their bold colors, spirited designsand pivotol roles in the evolution of visible air. As the countdown to the second annual Air Max Day continues, Niketakes a look back to remember the Icons of the Air Max Family: The Masters of Max.Innovation isn’t always visible — but when it is, its impact can be immeasurable. In 1987, Nike introduced the Nike Air Max 1, the first shoe to put innovation on full display. Created as a cushioning system, Nike Air suddenly became a window of opportunity for self-expression, style, and crucially, pure performance. The Nike Air Max 1 arrived as a provocateur and a revolutionary, and the sneaker world was never the same.Tinker Hatfield was the lead designer who brought the Air Max to life. At the time, Nike Air was nothing new. Introduced in late 1978 in the Nike Air Tailwind, the Air-Sole unit was effectively hidden in foam.However, Hatfield, a trained architect with a knack for changing the game, took a maverick piece of Parisian architecture as inspiration and cut away at the surrounding foam midsole to reveal a larger Air-Sole unit, proving its existence with audacious visibility.“I specifically went to Paris to see the city, but also to visit the Pompidou Center,” Hatfield says. “It was a building turned inside out, with a glass skin underneath. Coming back to Oregon, I had meetings with the technicians who were working on the larger Air-sole units and I relayed my thoughts: Maybe we could also expose the Air-Sole technology and create a shoe that's like no other.”At the time, many people considered the idea outlandish, but Hatfield and the team pushed forward. To further stand out from the era’s running shoes and drive home the message of visibility, the first Nike Air Max featured an attention-seeking bold color palette.The Air Max family has evolved over the past 28 years, with hundreds of memorable make-ups, but each model owes its existence in part to the transcendent Nike Air Max 1.The Nike Air Max 90 has presence. Even when standing still, the shoe looks like a masterpiece in motion.Arriving in 1990, this installment of the Air Max family featured a larger volume of Nike Air than its predecessors. However, its fluid aesthetic was the defining feature. Hatfield knew the silhouette would hit the ground running, so the design evoked forward motion.The Air Max 90 also included ribbed plastic panels and multiple lacing options to create the perfect fit. Color was another key ingredient. The shoe’s radiant shade of red, which later became known as “infrared,” highlighted the visible air. The hard-to-miss shade remains as synonymous with the Air Max 90 as its shape.Popular from the start, the striking Air Max 90 symbolized a new decade. Nike designers remixed the silhouette in the years that followed, but it stays forever coveted and essential.The Nike Air Max 180 was born from the collective minds of Hatfield and Air Force 1 designer Bruce Kilgore. The two legends set out to make the Max Air unit visible on the outsole and midsole, which highlighted the shoe’s 180 degrees of cushioning.The upper featured a new stretch dynamic inner sleeve that flexed with the foot, while the molded heel counter provided support. The forefoot grooves were another early experiment in natural motion.The shoe’s visible air was quickly recognizable around the world. Much like Nike introduced the Air Max 1 with a memorable commercial, the Air Max 180 was supported by advertisements created with legendary cartoonists, special effects masters and movie directors.For the Nike Air Max 93, visibility was the driving force. How do you shock an audience that has already been surprised time and time again? The heel unit had always been the focal point, so why not take it to its limit? Hatfield’s latest creation was built on the Air Max 90’s flex grooves and used a dynamic-fit neoprene inner sleeve to give the foot and ankle added support.Then there was the not-so-small matter of the 270-degrees of visible air. The precision-engineered blow-molded Air-Sole unit — inspired by plastic milk jugs — created completely new standards of cushioning and became the cornerstone for visible air in the forefoot.The Nike Air Max 95 was not just a shoe, it was an outcast.Debuting in 1995, the bold silhouette was the first to feature visible Nike Air in the forefoot. This completely new approach to cushioning brought runners superior comfort and support with dual air units. The Air Max 95 was the first Air Max model to feature a black midsole, a trait that drastically departed from traditional running shoe designs.This explosion of Air was the defining characteristic of a silhouette inspired by the human body. The midsole was based on the spine, serving as the backbone of the design. Nylon eyelets represented ribs, while the upper’s layered panels and mesh symbolized muscle fibers and flesh.The graduated approach to the upper, starting with a darker base, was meant to help the shoe remain clean even when used for off-road runs. Other key details included barely-there branding and a new Air Max typeface. And as with the Nike Air Max 1 and Nike Air Max 90, a statement color highlighted the Nike Air-Sole — this time from within.The Air Max 95 opened the front window in design and sparked a global movement. From New York to London to Tokyo, a generation wanted to wear the future on its feet. Multiple iterations later, it’s still turning heads.The Nike Air Max 97 marked another leap forward with the first full-length Max Air unit. The groundbreaking shoe demanded an upper to match its audacious innovation. Starting with silver, the fluid design took inspiration from Tokyo’s lightning-fast bullet trains. Reflective piping gave the Air Max 97 a look that amplified in the right light. The perfect shoe for a maximalist period, when more mattered in music, movies and style, it has since become an era-defining design classic.A minimized upper combined with a maximized approach to cushioning defines the Nike Air Max 2003. The new silhouette borrowed the same Air-Sole unit used in the Air Max 97, but new developments in molding, construction and cushioning brought the foot closer to the ground for extra flexibility. Taking a path less traveled, the Air Max 2003 traded the bold color of past Nike Air Max models for a tonal option that gave the shoe a new aesthetic for the aughts.The upper used a Teijin performance material similar to the one employed in elite track spikes and football boots. The material gave the shoe a lightweight, aggressive look and a premium feel, making it incredibly comfortable straight out of the box.Almost 20 years after the original Air Max debuted, the mission to make wearers walk on air was realized in the Nike Air Max 360. Nike engineered a completely new kind of Max Air unit that offered improved air-cushioned stability. Gone were the substantial layers of foam separating the foot from the air, and for the first time, thermo-molded construction helped achieve 360 degrees of cushioning.A tribute to the original Air Max color palette highlighted the latest breakthrough, while the laser-cut gradated effect on the upper resurrected the Air Max 95's look. A onetime-only limited edition pack even applied some iconic Air Max uppers to this new sole.The Air Max 2015 is as much about reinvention as it is about revolution. The performance running shoe features an upper that matches the dynamic motion of the flexible, ultra-comfortable Max Air cushioning that debuted in 2013. The first Air Max with a breathable, lightweight, fully engineered and almost seamless mesh upper works in tandem with Nike Flywire technology to wrap the foot. The shoe offers a plush, bouncy ride that uses tubular construction and flex grooves for the latest standard of maximum. Even the reverse Swoosh subverts familiarity and signs off on a new generation of expression.

collaborationsMarch 12, 2015NikeLab is a platform for creative exploration, driving new and unexpected outcomes through collaboration. The NikeLab x sacai partnership is the result of this journey. A shared passion for innovation and a bold expression of style served as the driving force behind the collaborative process, bringing to life a new women’s collection that transforms classic performance icons into functional sport hybrids.Renowned for her disruptive aesthetic, sacai’s founder Chitose Abe began the design journey by mining the Nike archives and pulling references from running, tennis and American football, reinterpreting Nike’s heritage sportswear silhouettes through a feminine and modern lens. The resulting eight-piece capsule collection seamlessly blends the iconic look of sport with a feminine and modern edge.“The idea of functionality is important to me, as is fabric innovation, which has always been at the heart of sacai,”Abe said. “For me, Nike is an original icon with performance and innovation at its core. It has been inspiring to work together.”The shared appreciation for innovative materials and technology was paramount to the Nike/sacai design process. Together the partners explored different ways to utilize the materials at hand and also establish exciting new fabrications. Celebrating Nike’s most iconic material innovation, the collection places special emphasis on two different weights of Tech Fleece, which has been reimagined into five signature sacai styles including the crew sweatshirt, crew hooded sweatshirt, crew top, crew knee-length dressand sweatpants.


New fabric innovations include a special mesh lace hem that was specifically developed by Nike and Abe to adorn the trim of graphic Nike T-shirts. The detail pays homage to sacai’s cool and subversive take on femininity. Abe also applied her signature paneling to several of the garments. Through technical innovation, the partners were able to achieve this effect by pleating the classic ripstop fabric for the first time. Bonded zippers that are attached without any stitching are another example of advanced design.“Abe has a fluidity and strength to her work that we feel is perfectly encapsulated within this collection,” said Kurt Parker, VP/Creative Director, Nike Sportswear.“The garments come to life as the wearer walks and moves, expressing both beauty and strength. We feel it’s a perfect marriage between sport and style.”Nike’s design ethos — to celebrate the body in motion — dovetails perfectly with sacai’s vision. Through Abe’s language of juxtaposition, the classic Nike Windrunner is reinterpreted as a skirt featuring plissé-style pleating . A hooded sweatshirt is not all that it seems with a peplum detail. These nuanced designs provide elements of surprise as the wearer turns from front to back. The panels combine with strategically placed openings and underlays to create fluidity when the garments are still or in motion, capturing the essence of Nike design through a sacai filter.“At Nike we study the body in motion,” Parker said.“Abe’s aesthetic and design sensibility naturally aligned with this focus and together we explored how to best express this notion during the development and material selection process. Abe’s unique take on movement re-contextualized the Windrunner in a completely new and unexpected way.”The full collection comprises eight distinct pieces of apparel in various bold colorways pulled directly from the Nike sport archive: the Tech Fleece crew, Tech Fleece hooded sweatshirt with zip, Windrunner jacket, Sport Skirt, Graphic tee, Tech Fleece dress, Tech Fleece crew top with back zipand Tech Fleece pant.


The NikeLab x sacai partnership also introduces a brand new interpretation of the iconic Air Max silhouette. The sneaker has been reworked into a unique slip-on style, honoring the theme of expression and freedom of movement that is prevalent in the collection. Constructed entirely of leather, the sneaker features an elasticized tongue that uses Fuse technology for ultimate comfort.


The seamless design represents Abe’s keen eye for tailoring, obsessing key details like the tromp l’oeil midsole, creating the illusion of a wedge. Hooking up with the lead colors of the collection, the Air Max is available in shades of obsidian/black with volt lining, volt/obsidian with volt lining, and wolf gray with volt lining.The NikeLab x sacai spring collection launches globally on March 19 in NikeLab doors in New York, London, Paris, Milan, Hong Kong, and Shanghai and on nike.com/NikeLab in North America, Western Europe, Japan, and China as well as select stores globally including Dover Street Market and colette. The collection will launch on March 25inJapan. The NikeLab x sacai summer collection, which will introduce new colorways and the addition of the Windrunner skirt, graphic Nike tank, and the NikeLabDunk Lux, will go on sale in June.

collaborationsFebruary 18, 2015At Nike, the unexpected is not unusual. It appears in anything from groundbreaking innovation to record-setting athletic performance.Sometimes, the most unexpected results are those born from collaborations. Working with creative partners pushes the Nike design team into new areas of exploration.The NikeLab x sacai collection is the latest example of this. Through a unique partnership, Nike and the internationally-renowned fashion house sacai reimagineNike classics. The result is the unexpected; disruptive silhouettes that redefine sport style.Chitose Abe is the designer and creative forcebehind sacai. A design maverick, Abe was eager to blend Nike’s material innovation and understanding of the body in motion with her unique style and unconventional construction. Based on traditional male Nike silhouettes, she transformed them into new styles with a feminine, modern edge.“I’ve always been inspired by classics,” Abe says. “Working with traditional silhouettes and ideas that often come from utility or performance-based sportswear, I’m interested in creating new hybrids that combine different fabrics and shapes to create an unexpected yet wearable result.”Abe is a master of dissecting classicand universal garments and reworking them to establish a masculine versus feminine interplay. Her passion for hybridsis apparent in her playful take on materials and in the way she contrasts textures of fabrics such as knits with fine wovens.This form of disruption has become the hallmark of her sacai label, and is now reflected in the new NikeLab x sacai women’s collection, set to launch globally March 19.

collaborationsJanuary 05, 2015Twenty-seven years ago, Nike designer extraordinaire Tinker Hatfield invented a concept that would stay fresh for the next three decades. By taking Nike Air technology, which had been in usesince 1979, and making it visible, Hatfield created the world’s first Air Max and forever changed running footwear design. Starting with the Nike Air Max 1, his concept would grow from a shoe to a family, transcend the boundaries of sportand kickstart a culture.The Nike Air Max family gains a new member in spring 2015 with the addition of the Nike Air Max 1 Ultra Moire. The fresh silhouette features a completely new outsole, which compared to the original, uses less material that results in dramatically improved flexibility and reduced weight.On top of the outsole sits a synthetic suede, laser-perforated, one-piece upper inspired by the Nike Air Zoom Moire + from 2006, the first Nike+ enabled shoe.





The Nike Air Max 1 Ultra Moire will bethe first ofNike's freshly-minted ""Sneaker of the Week"" program, which highlights one Nike Sportswear shoe a week. Itwill be available at Nike.com/sportswear and select Nike Sportswear retailers beginning Jan. 8.

collaborationsOctober 20, 2014Building on his rich partnership with Nike, designer Jun Takahashi complements his Fall 2014UNDERCOVER collection with three fresh renditions of the Nike Dunk Sky Hi. The idea of modern meets medieval extends fluidly into the Nike x UNDERCOVER Dunk Sky Hi collection with the inclusion of premium materials and faux animal prints.


Takahashi’s decision to use the Dunk Sky Hi as a canvas is no coincidence. Besides its popularity among his close friends, Takahashi was drawn to the Nike Dunk Sky Hi’s subtle modifications. The Dunk Sky Hi’s concealed wedge updates an iconic Nike basketball design with a new aesthetic while preserving its heritage. The Nike Dunk’s ability to represent those two opposites — pinnacle performance and street style — aligned perfectly with UNDECOVER’s design direction.Dressed in flooded color palettes of white, beige and black, the mixture of faux pony hair, debossed leather croc and snakeskin prints are subtly rambunctious and in sync with the idea of juxtaposing opposites.The Nike x UNDERCOVER Dunk Sky Hi collection will be available at nike.com/nikelab and at select NikeLab retailers beginning Oct. 30.

collaborationsAugust 12, 2014After German striker Mario Gotze's goal in the Nike Magista boots ended an incredible summer, it’s time to take on the new season and get back to football. With the action in Brasil motivating players everywhereto challenge themselves to get better, Nike'snew football collection has the products and services to help every player reach their full potential.First seen on the pitches in Brasil, and worn by more players than any other brand during the tournament,Nike offers the most innovative performance footwear the game has ever seen with the Hypervenom, Tiempo V, Magista and Mercurial Superfly. “This has been an unprecedented year of innovation for Nike Football. We believe that, just like we didwith the Mercurial R9 worn by Ronaldo in 1998, 2014 will be remembered as the year Nike changed football boots forever,” said Nike Football’s Design Director, Denis Dekovic.Nike’s year of design began in the summer of 2013 when Neymar revealed the Hypervenom. The boot, designed for the world’s most agile attackers, was an immediate hit with the likes of Neymar, Wayne Rooney and Daniel Sturridge.Just before the end of 2013, Nike launched the new Tiempo V. A new version of its classic Tiempo boot reinvented with innovation for the 21st century, Sergio Ramos and Carlos Tevez, amongst other players, found instant success in this classic design.Then in March2014, Nike launched the Magista.Building on Nike’s history of groundbreaking innovation, the Magista redefined how football boots look and perform, and scored Gotze’s winning goal in July.The design ethos of focusing on improved fit, touch and traction led to the new higher silhouette, which extended to the Mercurial Superfly, launched by Cristiano Ronaldo last April in Madrid and worn by Raheem Sterling and Alexis Sanchez, amongst others, in Brasil.In July, Nike Football launched a new digital and mobile application to feature the best of Nike football all in one place. The Nike Football app allows players increased access to the game and a chance to play more as they prepare for the season.The Nike Football App allows users to arrange matches, banter with friends and teammatesand have first access to exclusive Nike product. The new app is also a gateway to the professional game and a place in the Nike Academy through Most Wanted, which provides players a route to the pro game through fixtures against leading clubs.The Nike Football App is now available for free download on iTunes and Google Play.Nike, the official ball supplier to three of the biggest leagues in Europe — Barclays Premier League, Serie A TIM and La Liga BBVA — has unveiled thenew Ordem football for the start of the season. It is Nike’s most innovative, technologically advanced and aerodynamically tuned ball to date.In a game that’s more physically and technically demanding, the Nike Ordem football allows players to take control of the game knowing the ball will stay true. Built for the next generation of footballers, the Nike Ordem offers optimal touch with newfuse-welded panels, unprecedented flight control with new aerodynamic NIKEAEROW TRACgrooves and maximum visibility with NikeRaDaRtechnologyto help see the ball quicker.The Nike Flash Top Dri-FIT Elite offers a tailored fit for optimal comfort and range of motion with a seamless design that provides enhanced comfort on-pitch. The lightweight Dri-FIT knit fabrication helps keep players dry and comfortable with increased ventilation and sweat-wicking.The Nike Strike Short Elite features four-way stretch for enhanced freedom of motion and exceptional comfort on-pitch.Laser-cut ventilation and Dri-FIT fabric add increased breathability and wick sweat away from the body for increased comfort.To complete the on-pitch training look the Matchfit Elite Sock offers a pro-level fit that does notslip inside the boot.A lockdown traction pattern prevents this slipping, and a reinforced tow area is designed to reduce pressure and impact.Ultra-dine Dri-FIT knit fabrication provides a soft comfortable fit that keeps you cool and dry.

collaborationsDecember 02, 2013The Nike x Roundel by London Underground Air Max collectionusesa set of groundbreaking urban icons: Nike’s Air Max shoe and the London Tube – the world’s first underground railway– asinspiration for two striking new shoes withNike’sengineered woven Jacquard.The Nike x Roundel by London Underground collection represents the diverse and unique style that is synonymous with the city of London.Drawing on the very fabric of London, this collectionfeatures a vibrant pattern that takes inspiration from the famously boldseat upholstery found in the railway’s cars.Traditionally made from moquette (a hardwearing wool and polyester mix), the specially commissioned District geometric pattern was created by famed designer Misha Black and launched in 1978 for new trains on the District Line. Becoming a familiar sight for the city’s tube and bus commuters during the 1980s, the District design is a moquette that defined the debut years of theNike Air Maxfor generations of Londoners.Through a sophisticated weaving process the abstract fabric reproduced using woven polyester, debuts the Jacquard innovation and wraps both the Nike Air Max 1 and Air Max 90.This engineered one-piece woven updates the fit and feel of the classic Nike Air Max silhouettes, without compromising the expression of the iconic lines traditionally achieved through cut-and-sew methods.The Nike Air Max 90 Jacquard has an engineered one-piece poly weave upper made using the rigorous, age-old process of loomed Jacquard material. With contours characterized by pattern breaks that emulate the panels created by conventional construction, the shoe’s signature Swoosh and eye-row overlay panels are applied with a no-sew technique that uses heat and pressure for adhesion.The Nike Air Max 1 Jacquard is built from the same engineered poly Jacquard weave, but manufactured using traditional construction methods, including a stitch-and-turn technique on the overlay panels that produces a premium, crafted finish. A high density Swoosh gives the upper extra texture and TPU no-sew eye-row overlays prevent fraying.Both shoes also boast natural gum rubber outsoles and an embroidered tongue emblem of the celebrated London Underground logo, also known as the “Roundel.” To add to the sense of ceremony, the limited-edition sneakers will arrive in custom packaging featuring the distinctive moquette pattern.The Nike x Roundel by London Underground Air Max collection debuts Dec. 14,2013 at select retailers includingFootpatrol, Dover Street Market and 1948 London. The first 150 pairs will drop exclusively at the Piccadilly Circus station pop-up kiosk in London at 6am, and will include an additional gift in celebration of TFL's (Transport for London) 150th anniversary.

Respeitado dentro de campo pela sua seriedade e determinação, e fora dele pelo estilo brincalhão, o atleta aposta na ousadia tanto no esporte quanto na vida. Hoje David Luiz está no topo. É Max.O jogador teve um começo de carreira parecido com o das irmãs do vôlei Maria Clara e Carol Salgado e o surfista Pedro Scooby, que também estão na campanha Sejamax, de lançamento das coleções Nike Air Max Glow in the Dark e Nike Air Max Reflective. David Luiz contou com a ajuda familiar – mais precisamente do pai - para dar os primeiros passos nos gramados de Diadema (SP), onde nasceu. Jogando atualmente pelo futebol inglês, David Luiz fez da perseverança uma marca. Neste ano, foi aclamado como um dos heróis da final da Copa das Confederações ao evitar um gol praticamente feito do adversário. O Brasil inteiro comemorou a perna esticada em cima da linha e a bola voando pela trave para longe das redes.

collaborationsOctober 30, 2013A Nike presta homenagem às nações e às culturas que transformaram o Air Max em um ícone internacional atualizando o clássico sneaker com uma série de estampas de camuflagem vintage. Batizada de Nike Air Max Camo, a coleção será lançada no Brasil no dia 31 de outubro em um evento no bar da Absolut inn, na Loja Cartel 011, em São Paulo, que terá com exclusividade no CZO Footbox os modelos franceses, alemão, japonês e britânico.Lançado em 1987, o Nike Air Max surgiu como calçado de corrida, mas rapidamente foi adotado pelas ruas da Europa como um símbolo de expressão. A Coleção Air Max Camo conta e atualiza essa história por meio de padrões de camuflagem específicas de países como França, Alemanha, Itália, Japão e Reino Unido, além da tecnologia Nike Hyperfuse.Ao utilizar calor e pressão, a Nike Hyperfuse forma um material único e durável composto de três camadas, cada uma com foco diferente - uma para estabilidade, outra para respirabilidade e a terceira para durabilidade. O design final apresenta um estrutura única, deixando o tênis leve e sem costuras abrasivas.No entanto, o destaque da coleção está nas estampas, presentes tanto nos tênis quanto em suas caixas. O modelo da França transforma o Air Max 1 e o Air Max BW em uma fusão de camuflagem Estados Unidos/França. Já o da Itália para os Air Max 90 e Air Max 97 segue o estilo do início dos anos 90.A estampa da Alemanha foi lançada pela primeira vez em 1999, e agora enfeita o Air Max 1 e o Air Max 180.Por fim, os tecidos japoneses e britânicos – ambos de 1991 – remodelam o Air Max 90 e o Air Max 95.SERVIÇOOnde: Cartel 011 (Rua Artur de Azevedo, 517).Horário: das 19 às 22h.Som: DJs Tamenpi e Nuts.

What he, as an artist, considers a large edition size, Nike runs off in prototypes testing iterations of a new sneaker. And yet born from the dynamic between Tom's D.I.Y. aesthetic and the wide reaching Nike brand, comes an artisanal capsule collection, NIKECraft.Launched on the eve of Tom’s SPACE PROGRAM: Mars, this joint venture between Tom and the Nike design team fuses, in several significant ways, the design sensibility Sachs brings to space travel.Astronauts must be as fit as an elite athlete to even withstand the rigors of exiting the earth’s atmosphere. Their daily tasks require a substantial effort and endurance. Equally, their equipment must be up to the task of performing under the most unforgiving conditions.The journey itself would end up inspiring the Tom Sachs: NIKECraft collection - The Mars Yard Shoe, the Trench, The Marsfly Jacket, and the Lightweight Tote. Nike design and Sachs applied materials that have never been used in sportswear, taken from automotive air bags, mainsails for boats and the space suit itself. Each piece is packed with functionality that would prove useful in the voyage through space. Zipper pulls that double as storage containers, paracord that can be fashioned as a tourniquet and embellishments like the periodic table of elements screened on the inside of a jacket - they all merge visual interest with purpose.

collaborationsNovember 15, 2011Nike and Undercover founder and designer, Jun Takahashi, will come together once again to release its newest collection of high-performance running gear for Holiday 2011. Merging the best in modern innovation such as advanced lightweight, waterproof, breathable materials and traditional craftsmanship, the third installment to the Nike x UNDERCOVER Gyakusou collection is rooted in a simple philosophy that is focused on fulfilling a crucial mission: To create the best running product that strikes the perfect balance between style and absolute functionality.To exemplify the characteristics of this collection, Takahashi and his running crew, GIRA (GYAKUSOU International Running Association) a small but dedicated group of Tokyo-based runners, gathered in the still thriving center of historic Japanese culture, the city of Kyoto, to capture the beauty and functionality of the Nike x UNDERCOVER Gyakusou Holiday 2011 Collection through a short film named, Running Monks.Shooting in centuries old temples immersed in nature, the crew visited Tofuku-ji, a National Treasure of Japan, founded in 1236, and Kozan-ji, which is registered as an UNESCO World Heritage Site. Director and Art Director Tetsuya Nagato and Photographer Katsuhide Morimoto, frequent collaborators with Undercover and Takahashi, managed to obtain permission to shoot in some of Japan’s most significant and remarkable sites where, in general, you are not allowed to run insideTakahashi designed the clothes with thoughtful details that diminish distraction and enhance the meditative quality of running while fitting perfectly in the classically Japanese environment.The textures and colors used in the line suit the verdant setting ranging from variations of gray with bold pops of burnt orange. “From the 1st collection, I have a consistent concept on color. I pick the ones that blend well with the nature and the city at the same time, which is an important concept for Gyakusou,” says Takahashi. “During this shoot in Kyoto, I realize that the GYAKUSOU collection is representing these Japanese colors.”Reflecting the impressions of nature seen in the film, while, at the same time, the heather gray material is drawn from the world of men’s business wear, providing yet another contrast to the idyllic setting. “It is often the case that high tech woven materials are used for running apparel. But I selected a material that looks like wool or heather, to blend the impression of sportswear and basic men’s business suits, focusing a lot on the texture of the material,” explains Takahasi.The Nike x UNDERCOVER Gyakusou Holiday 2011 performance running collection will be available October at select retailers globally.
