"<p class=""text--p"">The story of the Nike x Tom Sachs Poncho is a reminder that good solutions take time to solidify. The product’s simplicity is deceiving. Its shapeshifting nature was perfected over the course of four years, dozens of prototypes, countless tests and innumerable hacks.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">The poncho began life in 2015 as one output of a design challenge to consider transforming apparel, and was undertaken by Jarrett Reynolds, Nike's senior design director for apparel special projects, and others. Reynolds was initially intrigued by the idea of a slimline pack complete with a quick-deploy poncho that pulled swiftly from its carry and could be easily repacked after use.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">""We used a tear-away zipper for the first incarnation. It allowed for the explosion — the forceful billowing that allowed the wearer to quickly get into the poncho — but it was really difficult to set up,"" says Reynolds.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">A collection of prototypes, including one made shortly after Sachs had an ""ah-ha"" moment on December 24, 2017.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">Despite its finicky nature, this prototype led to eight or nine other concepts, over the course of two years, each helping show proof of concept but never quite clicking, so Reynolds shared the poncho via video to a frequent Nike collaborator, Tom Sachs.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">“He was like, ‘We've got to do something with this.’ I was stoked because Tom and his team are problem-solvers, they look at things from a different perspective than we do and that’s what we needed,” says Reynolds. From there, the project blossomed into a collaborative, inventive exercise with the artist.  </p>","<p class=""text--p"">In conversation, Sachs discusses how the poncho went from speculative exercise to NIKECRAFT project.</p>","<p class=""text--p""><strong>Nike News: NIKECRAFT is a 50-50 enterprise between Nike and Tom Sachs. How does that work when it comes to this product? </strong><br/>
Tom Sachs: I want to start by reminding all of us that NIKECRAFT isn't just a brand, it's a philosophy and an approach to how we do stuff based on transparency and evidence of construction.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">Jarrett showed me the idea and expressed the problems with it — he said that it was too complicated. And I said, ‘No problem. We'll just make a movie about it.’ In doing that, we discovered it was as complicated as Jarrett suggested, so we began to work on different solutions.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">Through a lot of exploration and testing, the studio was able to find opportunity to push on an idea that had been stuck. We simplified the deployment mechanism and the repacking mechanism. We integrated things like a drag-racing inspired parachute release mechanism, an extension flap to the poncho and the fanny pack. </p>","<p class=""text--p""><strong>NN: When someone shows you something like Jarrett had with the breakaway zippers and this vague construct, where does your mind go? How did you get to drag racing?</strong><br/>
TS: When I saw his first prototype, I viewed it as a magic trick. Later, when I stumbled across the parachute release mechanism of a dragster and saw how it folded back, I saw how the problems that we were having with the complexity of the release mechanism were solved in other parts of industry. This particular mechanism, which allows a transition from fast to slow, served the purpose we needed.  </p>","<p class=""text--p"">These transitions are reflected in the season of springtime, and March is the puberty of the seasons. And it's a very difficult month, statistically it’s when most people lose their cell phones and their keys and their wallet because they're switching coats. Also, as you get caught in the rain during this time but rarely have a raincoat with you, I thought,<em> why not combine all these problems?</em> One thing that we’ve learned in the studio is that if you have a bunch of problems, sometimes adding more problems to the pile can start to solve the problems.</p>","<p class=""text--p""><strong>NN: The collection also includes down shorts. Why do we need those?</strong><br/>
TS: When I'm working in the studio — that's my athletic arena — when I wear shorts, I'm much more limber, I'm faster and I think better because I'm not constrained by fabric resistance in my knees.</p>","<p class=""text--p""><strong>NN: All of the pieces also have ceramic embellishments produced by the Sachs studio. How do you think about your own studio as part of this multi-faceted manufacturing process?</strong><br/>
TS: One of the greatest parts about working with Nike is being able to build things on a scale that the studio can never produce.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">I made some of these ceramic beads for other projects and I thought, <em>well, they're pretty quick to make, </em>and I thought,<em> wouldn't it be great if we could make one small part of the final product, and make many thousands?</em></p>","<p class=""text--p"">We set up a little factory of beadmaking and we fired 16,000 of them that are hand formed, drilled, marked with a Swoosh and a Tom Sachs logo. And you can see the fingerprints of individuals who made them on the pieces.</p>","<p class=""text--p""><strong>NN: Of course, other hands are involved in the process of making the pieces in the collection too. The poncho calls out Vietnam specifically. How important is the factory relationship with the collaboration of NIKECRAFT?</strong><br/>
TS: The factory we worked with in Vietnam is, really, one the best makers that I've worked with at Nike. They didn't just blindly do what they were told. And that's a true measure of a real collaboration. Together, we all worked to produce the product, and in the spirit of transparency, I think it's really worth talking about the individuals who make the things.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">Channeling all this into a finished NIKECRAFT product requires a healthy push-pull. Transparency <em>is</em> critical, as is sharing the underpinnings of how things work. The ingenuity of the thinking is solidified with a NIKECRAFT first: The poncho’s mechanics are patent pending.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">The poncho, which is the highlight of the NIKECRAFT Transitions collection (inclusive of the Mars Yard Overshoe and the previously mentioned down short), incorporates materials ranging from Dyneema®️ (the same super-strong fiber used on the Mars Yard Overshoe) for the trinity case behind the poncho, to those ceramic beads created by Sachs’ studio. A Fidlock buckle ensures ease of use for the waist strap, and the poncho itself was prepared from a three-layer waterproof and breathable fabric that allowed for minimal size with maximum coverage. Bold printing on the back of the garment proudly announces the location of manufacture: Vietnam.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">“The ideas in this collection — transparency of materials and of construction — are very well reflected, and I'm really honored by this body of work. They have the same value and integrity of the sculptures that I make in the studio,” says Sachs.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">And, while the products certainly could be displayed, Sachs believes strongly that they should not only be used, but also serve as an impetus to dig in and learn more. More about doing, about imagining and, above all, about process.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">The apparel elements of the NIKECRAFT Transitions collection launch April 27 in Japan to coincide with Sachs' ""Tea Ceremony"" exhibition at Tokyo Opera City Art Gallery. A global release will follow. </p>","<p class=""text--p"">Update February 8, 2020: Apparel from the NIKECRAFT Transitions collection is available globally February 15. The assortment includes the Nike x Tom Sachs Poncho, down shorts in black and white, cap and both long and short sleeved T-shirts. </p>"

"<p class=""text--p"">The latest Nike x Pigalle Collection </p>","<p class=""text--p"">Since 2014, Nike has worked with Parisian Stéphane Ashpool’s Pigalle in a mutual celebration of basketball’s pure cultural impact. The collaboration has generated a series of apparel and footwear collections, and also focused on supporting community-building programming by providing safe harbor for players. </p>","<p class=""text--p"">In September 2019, an initial court in Paris became a hub for the city's players and an international symbol for the game's creative impulses. In 2019, Ashpool and Nike aim to bring the Pigalle perspective on safe sport spaces to new cities.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">The Nike x Pigalle basketball court in Beijing</p>","<p class=""text--p"">""Our court in Paris birthed a community,"" says Ashpool. ""We transformed a parking lot into a place that has fostered a family and inspired people. All the subtle details that can make this magic happen were united. It was the best learning for me, and now it’s the right time to work in expanding this scheme, staying organic, authentic and focused.""</p>","<p class=""text--p"">A second Pigalle court also opened in Beijing, China in fall 2019. The location is testament to China's fervor for basketball, and the need to provide a place that can become part of the community fabric. ""The importance of the project is to give players the best outdoor facilities in order to make them comfortable enough to create something bigger,"" Ashpool says. ""We want the court to become a second home. That’s how you build a community organically around a space — we simply give them the right tools.""</p>","<p class=""text--p"">The court and surrounding space, covering an area of 600 square meters, was created with NIKE GRIND, amounting to a total of 45,000 pairs of recycled sports shoes. Throughout the year, the court will host a series of exclusive opportunities for female players — including organized activity through the city's high school basketball league and adjacent community groups. All this feeds into Ashpool's belief in basketball as a unifying force and the court as the heart of a healthy, creative community.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">The new Nike x Pigalle basketball court in Mexico City</p>","<p class=""text--p"">To round out 2019, Pigalle in December again joined forces with Nike to bring two refurbished basketball courts to youth in Mexico City.

The Chuck 70 comes in two colorways, one a play on Converse's iconic natural canvas, the other featuring a gradient scheme. Both are created with a technical fuse film atop the canvas, a design element that gives the shoes an aura of future tech and classic style. This supports Ashpool's desire to merge cultures, which also comes through in his use of Converse footwear to celebrate ""the power of music to move the world forward"" (a phrase used on the white Chuck 70's rand) and promote a holistic view of the progressive value of sport and arts. </p>","<p class=""text--p"">The latest Nike x Pigalle Collection and the Converse x Pigalle Chuck 70 and All-Star Pro BB release globally January 25 on nike.com, converse.com and at select retailers.</p>"

The cleat featured asymmetrical, off-center lacing for a larger boot-to-ball surface (which helps create a cleaner strike), as well as Zoom Air units in the outsole for optimal traction and stud pressure reduction.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">The Nike Phantom VNM Future DNA T90 pays tribute to its predecessor’s classic black, white and red colorway, and translates the 2002 cleat’s goal of precision through modern Phantom VNM technology to facilitate a powerful strike. Most notably, the new boot comes equipped with a Precision Pwr strike zone in the instep — 13 ridges set at specific angles and ascending heights to help keep the ball down and to provide a bite on its surface. </p>","<p class=""text--p"">The boot is the third release from the Nike Football’s Future DNA Pack, which finds Nike’s current performance boots each paying homage to a classic Nike Football design, and follows the release of the <a class=""text--link"" href=""https://news.nike.com/footwear/nike-phantom-vsn-2-future-dna-hypervenom"" target=""_blank"">Nike Phantom VSN 2 Future DNA Hypervenom</a> and the <a class=""text--link"" href=""https://news.nike.com/footwear/nike-mercurial-vapor-future-dna-mercurial"" target=""_blank"">Nike Mercurial Vapor Future DNA Mercurial</a>.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">The Nike Phantom VNM Future DNA T90 is available March 20 on nike.com. </p>","<p class=""text--p""><span class=""font--italic"">March 13, 2020 - </span>The Nike Mercurial Vapor ""Future DNA Mercurial"" brings classic Nike Football design to one of the brand’s latest on-pitch <a class=""text--link"" href=""https://news.nike.com/news/2019-mercurial-360-official-images-release-date"" target=""_blank"">innovations</a>.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">Originally released in 2009, the Nike Mercurial Vapor Superfly was the lightest, fastest iteration of the <a class=""text--link"" href=""https://news.nike.com/news/nike-mercurial-highlights-from-fast-to-faster"" target=""_blank"">Nike Mercurial</a> at the time, and served as a glimpse into the future of Nike football boots. For the first time on a boot, the original Nike Mercurial Vapor Superfly incorporated next-generation Nike Flywire technology in a streamlined upper. The purpose of the filament and fiber technology was to serve as a second skin, and offer a lightweight, stronger, more dynamic fit.

"<p class=""text--p"">The Converse x GOLF le FLEUR* Gianno</p>","<p class=""text--p"">For the past few years, Tyler, The Creator has been steadily building with Converse. His exploration of the brand’s classics, the One Star and the Chuck 70, have allowed for experiments in color, fit, material and proportion. His latest output, the GOLF le FLEUR* Gianno, pushes the lessons learned to new boundaries. The Gianno is a new concept, engineered from the ground up, and, as should be in a true signature shoe, it is distinctly Tyler, The Creator.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">""This was an opportunity to create a build that he could have ownership and creative input to,"" says Matt Sleep, Converse’s Footwear Design Director. ""We worked to craft a design language for Tyler with nods to Converse DNA and heritage. The intent was to create something that felt contemporary and fresh, but maybe not necessarily something that looked outwardly 'Converse' at first sight.""</p>","<p class=""text--p"">Synthesizing these considerations and some of Tyler's starting points — such as influences from outdoor footwear, running and basketball — results in something unconventionally multidimensional. While there are outdoor vibes, it isn't immediately a hiking shoe. And, while the midsole drafts off the ERX series, the basketball DNA is suppressed even if it comes across more overtly elsewhere.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">Equipped with a midfoot shank, the shoe is stable. The tread pattern is rugged and its nod to Converse's ’90s basketball archive is another surprise crossover element. ""The shoe is a combination of style and function,"" says Amy Rauner, Senior Footwear Designer at Converse. ""The multidirectional non-skid, lugged outsole should work in many different conditions —whether it be biking on BMX trails or hiking in the woods."" </p>","<p class=""text--p"">The mix of leather, nylon and suede gives the upper a rich dimensionality, while the various color choices allow Tyler to investigate both retro and contemporary influences, from current runway culture to the lineage of trail running. The sculpted, fitted upper hosts detailing, such as the mini debossed fleur motif, and reflective eye rows that weave through the design. These details provide intriguing depth to the sneaker from all angles.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">The Gianno outsole</p>","<p class=""text--p"">The Converse x GOLF le FLEUR* Gianno launches exclusively at Camp Flog Gnaw, with a global release November 11 on converse.com and Golf Wang Stores.

Even more enticing than its lightweight feel was its ability to stand out on the pitch: the cleat’s vibrant orange pop of color from the tongue, heel graphic, stud tips and laces created a stark contrast from the black premium leather upper (a signature of the Tiempo franchise). Nike Flywire technology was integrated into the leather for a midfoot lockdown and, overall, more dynamic fit, while enhanced vamp stitching was strategically placed for lateral agility.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">With tribute to its predecessor, the latest Nike Tiempo Legend 8 gets OG Tiempo Legend IV Elite color treatment. Its fit and feel is defined by the Legend 8’s stitchless, quilted diamond pattern upper and Flyknit Fit Tunnel, providing a supportive and snug fit around the midfoot. Additionally, the boot has Quadfit mesh in the forefoot to prevent overstretch of the outer leather layer.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">The boot is the fourth and final release from Nike Football’s Future DNA Pack, in which Nike’s current performance boots each pay homage to a classic Nike Football design, and follows the release of the <a class=""text--link"" href=""https://news.nike.com/footwear/nike-phantom-vsn-2-future-dna-hypervenom"" target=""_blank"">Nike Phantom VSN 2 Future DNA Hypervenom</a>, the <a class=""text--link"" href=""https://news.nike.com/footwear/nike-mercurial-vapor-future-dna-mercurial"" target=""_blank"">Nike Mercurial Vapor Future DNA Mercurial</a> and the <a class=""text--link"" href=""https://news.nike.com/footwear/nike-phantom-vnm-future-dna-t90"" target=""_blank"">Nike Phantom VNM Future DNA T90</a>.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">The Nike Tiempo Future DNA Tiempo Legend is available March 27 on nike.com. </p>","<p class=""text--p""> </p>","<p class=""text--p""><span class=""font--italic"">March 20, 2020 - </span>The Nike Phantom VNM Future DNA T90 brings classic Nike Football design to one of the brand’s latest on-pitch <a class=""text--link"" href=""https://news.nike.com/news/phantomvnm"" target=""_blank"">innovations</a>.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">Originally released in 2002, the Nike Air Zoom Total 90 II was the perfect blend of comfort, power and precision. Made of soft KN-100 — a strong, light material — the boot’s namesake stemmed from the creation of a cleat that would support player comfort for the total 90 minutes of a match. The cleat featured asymmetrical, off-center lacing for a larger boot-to-ball surface (which helps create a cleaner strike), as well as Zoom Air units in the outsole for optimal traction and stud pressure reduction.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">The Nike Phantom VNM Future DNA T90 pays tribute to its predecessor’s classic black, white and red colorway, and translates the 2002 cleat’s goal of precision through modern Phantom VNM technology to facilitate a powerful strike. Most notably, the new boot comes equipped with a Precision Pwr strike zone in the instep — 13 ridges set at specific angles and ascending heights to help keep the ball down and to provide a bite on its surface. </p>","<p class=""text--p"">The boot is the third release from the Nike Football’s Future DNA Pack, which finds Nike’s current performance boots each paying homage to a classic Nike Football design, and follows the release of the <a class=""text--link"" href=""https://news.nike.com/footwear/nike-phantom-vsn-2-future-dna-hypervenom"" target=""_blank"">Nike Phantom VSN 2 Future DNA Hypervenom</a> and the <a class=""text--link"" href=""https://news.nike.com/footwear/nike-mercurial-vapor-future-dna-mercurial"" target=""_blank"">Nike Mercurial Vapor Future DNA Mercurial</a>.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">The Nike Phantom VNM Future DNA T90 is available March 20 on nike.com. </p>","<p class=""text--p""><span class=""font--italic"">March 13, 2020 - </span>The Nike Mercurial Vapor ""Future DNA Mercurial"" brings classic Nike Football design to one of the brand’s latest on-pitch <a class=""text--link"" href=""https://news.nike.com/news/2019-mercurial-360-official-images-release-date"" target=""_blank"">innovations</a>.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">Originally released in 2009, the Nike Mercurial Vapor Superfly was the lightest, fastest iteration of the <a class=""text--link"" href=""https://news.nike.com/news/nike-mercurial-highlights-from-fast-to-faster"" target=""_blank"">Nike Mercurial</a> at the time, and served as a glimpse into the future of Nike football boots. For the first time on a boot, the original Nike Mercurial Vapor Superfly incorporated next-generation Nike Flywire technology in a streamlined upper. The purpose of the filament and fiber technology was to serve as a second skin, and offer a lightweight, stronger, more dynamic fit.

In respect for the function-first origins of those practical pieces, the shoe itself is striped down and the silhouette's features deftly reinterpreted for 2020. </p>","<p class=""text--p"">Approach to the design began first with  fabrication, trying to mix iconic sneaker fabrics, such as nubuck leather and hairy suede, with translucent materials and technical mesh to give a modern vibe to a classic silhouette.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">This approach lead to some restructuring of the shoe's paneling to both reduce material and streamline the upper pattern. The Swoosh is thus elongated and the typical rubber ""Air Max"" marker above the Air-unit window is removed. Padding in the tongue and heel is also minimized, adding to the sleeker form. Additional details include a heel pull tab and tongue lacing reminiscent of the Nike Vomero 5. </p>","<p class=""text--p"">The colorways are a study in contrast — a concise, all-black look highlighting the depth and texture of the build, and a blue Undefeated exclusive, honoring past Nike ACG and Running footwear and apparel.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">The Undefeated exclusive colorway was inspired by the colors and hues that came out of the golden era of running shoes — the late ’80s and early ’90s — and the pop colors of outdoor sneakers that were making noise from ’92 to ’95 in NYC.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">The black Undefeated Nike Air Max 90 launches March 14 at Undefeated stores, followed by a second release March 19 on SNKRS.

The collection's name, ""No Cover,"" is somewhat of a double entendre to a cover charge one would associate with New York nightlife. In Kim's eyes, this collection is meant for everyone - men and women, the young and the old - in order to promote no judgements and no rules. </p>","<p class=""text--p"">Additionally, Kim’s selection of the silhouettes is predicated on her own latent desires: While she loves New York streetwear from the 90's, at a time when a majority of the fashion-forward styles and fresh colors were made for men and she could never find anything in her size. </p>","<p class=""text--p"">Paired with the statement footwear designs that reimagine Nike icons of the era, the collection's apparel is reminiscent of Kim’s own free-spirited teenage wardrobe. The collection features vibrant pink, volt, blue, orange and red colors, with the fleece hoodies and graphic tees featuring mini swooshes in glitter pink. </p>","<p class=""text--p"">Some of the pieces from the Nike by Olivia Kim apparel capsule include:</p>","<p class=""text--p"">""Megan Rapinoe, as a Nike and female athlete, is talking about some really important things,"" says Kim.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">""Binx is beautiful, and a strong influence to young people,"" says Kim of model Binx Walton.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">""I've always been inspired by John, because he's always pushed the boundaries in his work,"" says Kim.

"<p class=""text--p"">The Fall 2019 Nike Gyakusou Collection</p>","<p class=""text--p"">If one considers <a class=""text--link"" href=""https://www.nike.com/w/gyakusou-5ul4i"" target=""_blank"">GYAKUSOU</a> a club — the GYAKUSOU International Running Association (GIRA) — its constituents are those who value running for its intangible benefit: finding elusive peace. For fall 2019, Jun Takahashi gave this value a physical incarnation by pulling graphic inspiration for the latest GYAKUSOU collection from the bold rebel spirit of the 1970s running revolution. This was the decade that running emerged as a pursuit disconnected from competition, and the enduring energy of the time has become a rallying point for successive generations of runners.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">While Takahashi typically tackles urban running, this GYAKUSOU output considers the trail. At center is the Nike Air Zoom Pegasus 36 Trail, a crossover trainer that offers easy transition from trail to road. Surrounding the shoe is a six-piece apparel assortment that includes a rain top with zip-off hood, long-sleeve top, two short-sleeve tops, shorts and a multi-functional pant. As expected, Takahashi employs cutting-edge performance fabrics for each piece, and adds to articulated storage solutions.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">The Fall 2019 Nike Gyakusou Collection</p>","<p class=""text--p"">The Fall 2019 Nike Gyakusou Collection</p>","<p class=""text--p"">The Fall 2019 Nike Gyakusou Collection</p>","<p class=""text--p"">The Fall 2019 Nike Gyakusou Collection</p>","<p class=""text--p"">The duality of the Peg Trail shoe is captured by its two color schemes: one a classic red, white and blue expression and the other in Takahashi's now familiar mix of earthy tones. Additionally, Takahashi has placed a rose on the Peg Trail — the flower's beautiful petals and sharp thorns emblematic of the designer's balance/chaos ethos. Running, naturally, brings Takahashi balance, and in its freedom, he's able to dream up new ideas. The intent with GIRA is that it provides fuel for others to do the same.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">The Nike Air Zoom Pegasus 36 Trail</p>","<p class=""text--p"">The Nike Air Zoom Pegasus 36 Trail</p>","<p class=""text--p"">Fast Facts on the Nike Air Zoom Pegasus 36 Trail:</p>","<p class=""text--p"">1.

"<p class=""text--p"">Naomi Osaka wearing the Nike x sacai fall 2019 apparel collection and LDWaffle</p>","<p class=""text--p"">Chitose Abe describes intuition as a guiding force. Things have to make sense for the sacai founder, even when creating something never-before-seen. Her latest project with Nike follows accordingly. The 11-piece collection combines the past and present of Nike’s running apparel innovations through a tour de force of strikingly-contrasted logos, patterns, colors and hemlines.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">The output channels Abe’s signature design language, which brings a new irreverence to running style and extends a partnership with Nike that began in 2014. ""sacai was just at the beginning of its foray into the international realm,” says Fraser Cooke, Special Projects Senior Director. “We saw immediately that Abe is very good at mixing up sportswear with high fashion. One of the things that we thought was really interesting about working with sacai was her way of layering and draping.” </p>","<p class=""text--p"">Belief in Abe’s work with sportswear and military icons has rung true.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">The Nike x sacai skirt is ispired by the styling of a jacket, like the Nike Windrunner, tied around the waist.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">“Often, I take the things I like from two different items of clothing and splice them together to create a whole that is bigger than the sum of its parts,"" explains Abe. ""I express the end result as a ‘hybrid.'""</p>","<p class=""text--p"">Her capacity to deconstruct and reconstruct ideas — a hallmark of sacai — gives an unmistakable character to the current collaborative effort. The process also allows for a twofold hybridization. The first is a melding of ideas, the second in true balance of activity.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">“There has to be a genuine interest or connection in order for me to create something new and unexpected,"" says Abe. ""Another important thing is that the partnership needs to contribute exactly half the work.""</p>","<p class=""text--p"">Sky Brown wearing the Nike x sacai fall 2019 apparel collection and Blazer</p>","<p class=""text--p"">A firm appreciation for Nike’s history and heritage comes through in Abe’s reimagining of running garments. She transforms the storied Windrunner into a skirt, grants an irreverence to the usually mundane half-zip and adds a refined edge to the classic Tiempo short. Her longstanding virtuosity in layering and draping is on full display.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">Nike’s mastery in shoe design is clear in making Abe’s imagined footwear fusion tangible. “We literally got two photocopied pictures of two different shoes that they folded in half and put on top of each other,” says Cooke of the beginning stages of the Nike x sacai LDWaffle.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">The resulting sneaker, a sterling example of equal contribution, certainly creates an entity greater than a simple mash-up of its components. It is symbolic of the Nike x sacai running collection as a whole — rethinking the relationship between craft, material and symbol with aplomb.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">The Nike x sacai apparel drops in September alongside new colorways of the LDWaffle and Blazer.</p>"

This is true of the Patta x Jordan collection, inclusive of the Air Jordan VII “Patta,” a track suit, shorts, T-shirt and bucket hat, which marks the first time Jordan Brand has partnered with a European brand. TEAM PATTA uses the relationship as a conduit for relaying personal nostalgia about the Jordan VII and the early '90s to their current audience.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">For Patta’s Guillaume Schmidt and Vincent van de Waal, the Jordan VII was the logical starting point for working with Jordan Brand. Launched in ’92, and subsequently eternally tied to that summer’s USA Basketball team, the Jordan VII arrived at a transformative point in both men’s youth and their respective interest in the culture they live and work within.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">“It was a golden era for hip-hop. It was a big time for me, a lot of very important albums that I carry with me still came out between '92 and '96.

The VII also has a reference to Africa,” says Guillaume, a native of Suriname who grew up an hour from Amsterdam in basketball-crazed's Hertogenbosch.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">Vincent, Patta’s creative director, was drawn to the Jordan VII’s elegant shape and the minimal marking (it was the first in the Jordan line without any Nike branding). Today, Vincent is effusive about the shoe, stating, “It is my all-time favorite.”</p>","<p class=""text--p"">The footwear itself plays only part of the story, as both Guillaume and Vincent recognized immediately the power of the full package surrounding the VII. “The VII apparel was out of this world. The products that we worked on come straight from a short Jordan clip from Barcelona that became super famous. It features a segment where Michael walks past a huge billboard of himself where he's got the shoes on, and that image has been forever etched in my memory,” says Guillaume.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">Reviving the pattern of those original garments, Patta is also able to tie in its branding subtly though incorporation of “TEAM PATTA” word marks. “We see ourselves as a strong team where everybody has their place, so the concept of ‘TEAM PATTA’ has always been important to our history,” says Vincent.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">The Patta x Jordan Collection releases May 18 at Patta’s Amsterdam and London locations, as well as on <a class=""text--link"" href=""http://patta.nl"" target=""_blank"">patta.nl</a>.

For example, the long-sleeve top can be modified for width, while the T-shirt allows for fine-tuning of the arm holes. This creates opportunities to personalize drape and scale, alternately loose and oversized or streamlined.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">Takahashi’s bold approach to carrying personal essentials gives each garment a distinct functional value. Most radically, the hood of the tracksuit functions as a pocket and the body has zippered mesh pockets at the back to complement the more traditional kangaroo front pocket.

Both long-sleeve top and T-shirt also incorporate mesh.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">Subtle “CHAOS BALANCE” text, a longstanding UNDERCOVER motif, embellish each garment and signify the brand’s philosophy of marrying raw energy and technical expertise.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">The Nike x UNDERCOVER Daybreak</p>","<p class=""text--p"">Debuted during UNDERCOVERS's spring/summer 2019 Paris runway show, Takashi's examination of the Nike Daybreak completes the assortment.

When the lining was cut, it was discovered that the collar created a natural pocket that could be sealed with a Velcro enclosing.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">Scott’s individual touches extend to the minimal Cactus Jack branding, which is employed so as not to overpower the minimal design of the shoe. These understated elements come via the embossed heel, tongue patch and an inner mid-panel that all feature Scott’s hand-sketched logos.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">Scott’s debut apparel collection with Jordan Brand complements the Air Jordan I. This collection re-imagines Jumpman essentials — fleece hoodie, fleece shorts, a tracksuit and tees — with Cactus Jack colors and imagery.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">“The apparel collection is just another form of expression and design. It brings the creative of the shoe to other lifestyles pieces for the brand,” says Scott.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">The Air Jordan I High OG Travis Scott and apparel collection releases globally May 11 at the following locations:</p>","<p class=""text--p"" style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><strong><span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"">NORTH AMERICA</span></span></strong></p>","<p class=""text--p"" style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in""><span style=""font-size:12pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri,sans-serif"">SNKRS (Get notified <a class=""text--link"" href=""https://www.nike.com/launch/t/air-jordan-1-high-travis-scott/?sitesrc=snkrsIosShare"" target=""_blank"">here</a>)</span></span><br/>

"<p class=""text--p"">Nike Air Fear of God Raid</p>","<p class=""text--p"">Jerry Lorenzo saw the Nike Air Raid for the first time as a high school sophomore when a fellow student came into class with it on. The shoe itself was an immediate object of desire. Lorenzo loved the gray and black color scheme, he said, and the nuances of the geometric patterns and the impact of the crossed straps. He noted there was a positive, pro-Black feeling about it. It was the first Nike shoe outside of Jordan he had an emotional connection to.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">""When the kid walked in the classroom with the Air Raid, no one told me that I was supposed to like the Air Raid. I was just drawn to it, the design, the colors. It was like, oh my God, what is <em>that</em>?"" Lorenzo recalls. ""It became interconnected with all these other real emotional things that were happening at the time of the shoe.""</p>","<p class=""text--p"">As he learned more about sneaker culture, Lorenzo discovered that the Raid was designed for playground use. It wasn’t strictly off-court, instead it was an early channeling of basketball culture into a physical manifestation. The Raid was a vibe — sport and spirit in fashionable unison.</p>","<p class=""text--p""><strong>Here’s where sport and style carry a different groove though</strong>: Lorenzo’s most memorable collegiate sporting experience doesn’t come from play but from a halftime show.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">1998, six years after the Air Raid released but still within the time frame of the cultural epoch it was birthed in, Lorenzo was at Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University (FAMU), his alma matter, for homecoming. The traditional half-time battle of the bands struck off with the opposition re-purposing a Miami bass banger.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">""Everyone went crazy, and we were just so demoralized. We were just like, what are we going to do? How can we top that?"" he remembers. </p>","<p class=""text--p"">FAMU's band comes on and throws a curveball. It didn't play a current hit. Nor did it pull in a prior fan favorite. Instead, the band ripped into the horn section from a deep cut of an Atlanta duo’s recently released third album. The stadium exploded. The visceral energy of sport in action — a common language utilized as an ignition point. It was a reminder that the experience of sport is multifaceted.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">""It was the emotion of that feeling, the soul of that feeling — watching the stadium being rocked side to side that serves as a measuring stick of what I'm trying to do emotionally every time through product,"" says Lorenzo.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">Nike Air Fear of God reversible jersey, Nike Air Fear of God woven pant, Nike Air Fear of God Raid worn by WNBA player Diamond DeShields of the Chicago Sky</p>","<p class=""text--p"">As the lead element of the second Nike Air Fear of God release, the Nike Air Fear of God Raid, extends the notion of spirit from the court to the larger cultural milieu around the game. It reminds that the aural and the visual are equally important in defining the tenor of time.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">Because of that the Nike Air Raid is a perfect conduit for Lorenzo's <a class=""text--link"" href=""https://news.nike.com/news/nike-air-fear-of-god"" target=""_blank"">design construct</a>. Giving it new shape and new life doesn't recreate the past, it gives the present time an object of its own to with which to shepard the tone of <em>this</em> time.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">Nike Air Fear of God SPSU19 Collection</p>","<p class=""text--p"">Nike Air Fear of God warm-up pant, Nike Air Fear of God Raid</p>","<p class=""text--p"">Nike Air Fear of God parka, Nike Air Fear of God hoodie</p>","<p class=""text--p"">Nike Air Fear of God long-sleeve henley, Nike Air Fear of God reversible jersey, Nike Air Fear of God woven pant, Nike Air Fear of God Raid (F&amp;F colorway)</p>","<p class=""text--p"">Nike Air Fear of God warm-up top, Nike Air Fear of God all-over print woven pant, Nike Air Fear of God Raid</p>","<p class=""text--p"">Nike Air Fear of God warm-up top, Nike Air Fear of God warm-up pant, Nike Air Fear of God Raid</p>","<p class=""text--p"">The second drop of Nike Air Fear of God follows Lorenzo's desire to honor Nike's historically strong design language through modern shape and proportion.

"<p class=""text--p"">The legacy of Air may be sustained by Nike’s <a class=""text--link"" href=""https://news.nike.com/news/history-of-nike-air"" target=""_blank"">robust internal collaboration</a>, but its vibrancy is supported by cross-pollinating ideas with a variety of global talents. In sneaker terms, this equates to the “x” in Nike’s creative partnerships. The resulting products have yielded radical reconsiderations, far-out articulations and some of the most sought-after visions of Air ever.<br/>
 <br/>
The latest of these come from a quartet of intriguing and ambitious Air Max designs from Tokyo-based Atmos, Edison Chen's venerable CLOT, New York's Heron Preston and the elusive Cactus Plant Flea Market. Each offers a distinct take on an Air Max classic with a different starting point — remixed, recreated, re-tooled and re-imagined, respectively. </p>","<p class=""text--p""><strong>The Nike x Atmos Air Max 2 Light</strong> remixes a mid-90s design with a a full-blown, all-over print aesthetic. It will be released globally on April 5.</p>","<p class=""text--p""><strong>The Nike x Clot Air Max 97/Haven</strong> melds the upper of the cult-classic Nike Zoom Haven (introduced in 2000 and, incidentally, a platform for an early fashion collaboration) with the Air Max 97 tooling. In this, CLOT recreates Air Max in an all-new articulation. The shoe's global release comes May 8.</p>","<p class=""text--p""><strong>The Nike Air Max 720/95 Heron Preston By You</strong> marries the Air Max 720 and Air Max 95 while highlighting the Air-Sole with an Air-wrapped upper. The shoe is available for customization beginning April 15.</p>","<p class=""text--p""><strong>The Nike x CPFM Air VaporMax 2019</strong> reimagines the VaporMax aesthetic with unique upper embellishments that convey a Just Do It attitude. It drops May 14 exclusively at Dover Street Market locations.</p>"
"<p class=""text--p"">Harlem-born A$AP Nast has developed his singular aesthetic through an expressive bend of fashion concepts and hip-hop style. </p>","<p class=""text--p"">Nast worked with Converse footwear designers Julian Guzman and Matt Sleep to give the Jack a utilitarian vibe appropriately honoring his love for the outdoors.

"<p class=""text--p"">Mr. Link in the Missing Link x Nike Air Max Susan</p>","<p class=""text--p"">Mr. Link, the protagonist of LAIKA's new film, ""Missing Link,"" is the inspiration behind the latest collaboration between Nike and the animation studio. In the story, Mr. Link, a lovable creature, supports Sir Lionel Frost, the world's greatest monster chaser, on a globetrotting adventure to find a remnant of Mr. Link’s primitive ancestry. The Missing Link x Nike Air Max Susan, designed by Nike VP of Advanced Concepts, Tinker Hatfield, and former animator Michael Berger, translates the materials and textures of Mr. Link's plaid suit, created by LAIKA costume designer Deborah Cook, to a Nike Air Max 1.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">""Costume isn't a separate entity from character design, it's very much intrinsic,"" says Deborah Cook. ""If Mr. Link was wearing completely different clothes, you'd read him in a very, very different way.""</p>","<p class=""text--p"">Cook explains that Mr. Link's aesthetic plays up the character's Pacific Northwest roots and balances it with a desire to serve as playful foil to the urbane Frost.

"<p class=""text--p"">Matthew Williams, founder of 1017 ALYX 9SM, says he is fascinated by opportunities afforded by Nike's varied suite of digital design tools.

"<p class=""text--p"">The Converse x JW Anderson Run Star Hike</p>","<p class=""text--p"">Jonathan Anderson’s latest collaboration with Converse began with an established desire — merge a Chuck Taylor with a runner — and quickly evolved as a study in blending a Converse icon with a new, very different Converse silhouette. The result, the Converse x JW Anderson Run Star Hike, drew immediate attention when it debuted during the designer’s Spring/Summer 2019 Collection show last September in London.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">In principle, the silhouette is a declaration on contemporary mash-up culture, while in practice, it's a deft articulation of gamesome exploration of proportion and stance.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">“Contrasting proportions have always been part of my design aesthetic. When I approached this latest Converse, I was looking to re-create the same aesthetic by pairing the sole of a Run Star with the classic Chuck Taylor to emphasize the proportions,” says Anderson.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">This approach presented a challenge in engineering: how to retain integrity of individual parts and still present a strong catalyst for visceral reaction.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">Thus, building the Converse x JW Anderson Run Star Hike required some ingenuity in design. Anderson didn't touch the upper; it rounds the foot with the same graceful, narrow sweep as it did in the '70s. He accentuated this simple shaping by using the tooling of the <a class=""text--link"" href=""https://news.nike.com/footwear/converse-run-star"" target=""_blank"">Converse Run Star</a>, a heritage-style, injection-molded running shoe. It's the antithesis of the Chuck in terms of chunk and presents an intriguing stack height. Scale was also added through the addition of a sawtooth tread, effectively forming a three-part shoe (upper, midsole, outsole) wherein each portion can be read easily from distance.   </p>","<p class=""text--p"">The date “1917” honors the birth of the All-Star.</p>"
"<p class=""text--p"">The Converse x P.A.M. collection taps the versatility and cross-cultural adoption of the Chuck 70 across decades to create a sneaker that muses function with new world styling, allowing the wearer to adapt and interpret it on their own.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">When unzipped, the silhouette transforms into a canvas slip-on Chuck 70 with a dual-branded tongue patch and gold side panel.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">Perks and Mini (P.A.M.) co-founders Misha Hollenbach and Shauna Toohey believe even the most classic of silhouettes benefit from mutations in form — as long as its physical transformation contemplates the future.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">“Mutation is about evolution and the idea of what’s to come, what the future could be. It is not a rigid or singular way of thinking. It is an openness. We must adapt,"" say the designers.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">The Paris-based lifestyle brand taps into that theme with its collaborative take on the Chuck 70 and select Converse apparel.

"<p class=""text--p"">The world's best finishers — the likes of American Alex Morgan and Englishman Harry Kane — have something in common: Each knows that for every perfect, thrilling set ball goal, there are dozens of toe taps, heel flicks and hits off the outside of the foot. The value on the score sheet is the same, and the most proficient scorers come equipped with a nose for a goal and a litany of skills for converting their opportunities.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">""My finishing is a balance between power and placement,"" says USWNT star Alex Morgan. ""It depends where I am in the box, but I'd say my focus is usually 60/40 accuracy versus power.” </p>","<p class=""text--p"">That style of finishing is why the design of the <a class=""text--link"" href=""https://store.nike.com/us/en_us/pw/phantom-soccer-shoes/19fhZ896Zoi3"" target=""_blank"">PhantomVNM</a> features a series of textured zones to facilitate a powerful strike, but with an understanding that all of the power in the world won’t score without the accuracy to keep the shot on goal. This emphasis is most evident in the instep’s Precision Pwr strike zone.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">The 13 ridges of the instep's Precision Pwr strike zone are set at specific angles and ascending heights to help keep the ball down if it is mishit and to provide bite on the ball.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">The plate, which takes inspiration from Nike Free, is flexible in the forefoot for toeing off the ground with torque for sharp cuts.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">PhantomVNM increases the strike zone area by covering the laces, giving PhantomVNM a 30-percent larger strike zone than <a class=""text--link"" href=""https://news.nike.com/news/nike-hypervenom-3"" target=""_blank"">Hypervenom3</a>. </p>","<p class=""text--p"">“We teamed up with our research lab to utilize a robotic leg to test strikes from a variety of angles with urethane injected ‘blades’ across the instep,” notes Jeongwoo Lee, Senior Design Director for Nike Football Footwear. “This enabled us to go deep statistically on the impact that the various blade iterations had on accuracy, elevation, power and spin. The lab data helped us land on the exact specifications of Precision Pwr strike zone built for finishers.”</p>","<p class=""text--p"">The 13 ridges of the Precision Pwr strike zone are set at specific angles and ascending heights to help keep the ball down if it is mishit and to provide bite on the ball. Much like its counterpart in the <a class=""text--link"" href=""https://news.nike.com/news/nike-football-phantomvsn-boot"" target=""_blank"">Phantom family</a>, PhantomVNM increases the strike zone area by covering the laces, giving PhantomVNM a 30-percent larger strike zone than <a class=""text--link"" href=""https://news.nike.com/news/nike-hypervenom-3"" target=""_blank"">Hypervenom3</a>. But, PhantomVNM does build off the Hyper-Reactive plate made famous on the Hypervenom3. The plate, which takes inspiration from Nike Free, is flexible in the forefoot for toeing off the ground with torque for sharp cuts. This iteration of the HyperReactive plate also strays from traditional plates by exposing its faceted structure.

"<p class=""text--p"">Founded in 2011, Tokyo-based Cav Empt is the brainchild of renowned graphic artist Sk8thing and England-born Toby Feltwell.

We started C.E. a decade later, and though we were in Tokyo, images from that time and place have been consistently with us,"" says Toby Feltwell. ""We looked at this opportunity to work with Nike as a way to interact with these images more directly. We are engaging in a sort of time travel. The project with Nike has allowed us to work in the present to redesign our past.""</p>","<p class=""text--p"">The articulation of the Nike x C.E. tracksuit pant is evidence of this action. A cinching behind the knee changes the silhouette from a straight leg to a more attractive, updated fit. As Feltwell notes, C.E.'s approach is not an exercise in authenticity. ""We're not directly appropriating stuff, but we're seeing various things that interest us and trying to highlight them,"" he says.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">This theme carries into the patterns and word play that C.E. has become synonymous with.

"<p class=""text--p"">Martine Rose began designing her version of the Nike Air Monarch by fitting a size 18 upper to size 9 tooling, resulting in this extraordinary shape.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">“I have never been interested in fashion. I've always been interested in how people interact with clothes,” says London-based menswear designer Martine Rose.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">Her first collaboration with Nike, a capsule featuring tracksuits, football jerseys and a completely re-articulated Nike Air Monarch, is indicative of this fascination. It plays, as much of Rose’s work does, on distorted proportion. Similarly, it follows the ethos of her design: finding things that appear ordinary but have something extraordinary about them and transforming those into items that are, in Rose’s words, “really quite exceptional.”</p>","<p class=""text--p"">Most often, the transformation takes place in experimenting with form fit. It is always also an exercise in rule breaking and clashing context.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">“When we started, we never just followed the rules, really because our access was blocked. For one reason or another we had to find different ways to show,” says Rose. And though her brand now has staged shows in local London markets and rock-climbing gyms, when it came to her Nike collaboration, Rose revisited her roots and opted for a clandestine collection launch last week. The location? Craig’s List — a digital space far removed from hype cycle norms.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">As for the clashing contexts, here are the key elements behind the formation of Rose’s Nike collaboration:</p>","<p class=""text--p"">Excess material on the track pant is framed by a pleat on the wearer’s right leg. The jacquard football jersey is highlighted by an elongated striped neck rib, and its oversized fit is augmented with excess volume pleated into the sleeve.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">For the tracksuit and football shirt, the process began with a spot of imagination — a seven-foot spot, to be exact. “Basketball players are superhuman — their bodies have formed in different ways because of their profession. We looked at a lot of players and their proportions. We then re-imagined their clothes on average-size people. For example, if I were wearing one of their tracksuits, I would have to repurpose it in order to fit my proportions; I’d have to tuck the seams,” explains Rose.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">“It was very intentional to use the Monarch as the silhouette, being a very American shoe, and then put it with the very English silhouette of the tracksuit,” says Rose.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">To give that very ordinary shoe a very extraordinary shape, Rose relied on Nike’s undisputed expertise in footwear. “Collaborations are about communication. We wanted some of the forms to spill over the base and we wanted the heel on the outfit to be further out than the sole…things we were initially told couldn't be done,” she says. “But everyone kept on pushing and we ended up developing these new shapes and ideas.”</p>","<p class=""text--p"">The shape itself follows on the same imaginative exercise as the apparel, but with more even experimentation — beginning with fitting a size 18 upper to size 9 tooling. Bringing this vision to commercial life required inventive development. Thus, Rose’s Air Monarch was built as a series of molds that were topped with stretched synthetic leather. Only one shoe has a similar construction, itself an American standard: the Nike Foamposite.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">Though ubiquitous, silhouettes from sport are now as common on the high street as on a Paris runway. For Rose, this speaks less to trend and more to spiritual connection.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">“<a class=""text--link"" href=""https://store.nike.com/us/en_us/pw/sportswear/ofr"" target=""_blank"">Sportswear</a> has been appropriated for years by various youth movements in England and America. The acceptability makes it so interesting. People can mix it in with any other type of wardrobe,” she says. “Again, I’m very interested with how people interact with clothes.

Irving’s embrace of <a class=""text--link"" href=""https://store.nike.com/us/en_us/pw/skateboarding/9yq"" target=""_blank"">Nike SB</a>, past and present, is well known. Prior special-editions of his signature line have paid respect to favored SB colorways, and last year, Concepts’ famed Lobster motif graced versions of the KYRIE 4. </p>","<p class=""text--p"">“These guys are unbelievable creatives. What I love is that Concepts has always identified specific cultural touchpoints and pushed things that make them their own,” says Irving. </p>","<p class=""text--p"">With Irving, the Concepts idea draws from the all-seeing eye within the athlete’s Hamsa hand tattoo. Rather than replicate it (given that the tattoo is a major theme of the KYRIE 5 heel counter and box), Point decided to dig into the history of Egypt’s ancient pyramids. “I found out the mortar used remains a mystery to scientists — they still can't figure how it stuck together, but it's some of the strongest stuff ever made. I learned that the limestone glowing in the sun made the pyramids glow brighter than a diamond. And one thing that really got me: there was a 20-ton door on one of the pyramids that was so precise, you can’t squeeze a credit card through the seams — but it can be opened with one hand,” he says. </p>","<p class=""text--p"">These facts, figures and myths combine in the Concepts x KYRIE 5 Ikhet to form an intriguing play of color and modeling. They give dimension to the shoe’s distinctive flytrap lacing, which is imbued with the type of nuances Point and team are known for.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">“It's a great collaboration with great people behind it who are thinking outside of the box.

""I used to sit outside the Garden listening to games on the radio, just wishing I could score a ticket to get in when they were dominating throughout the '80s.

"<p class=""text--p"">For many sneaker and basketball fans, the natural answer to the question “<a class=""text--link"" href=""https://news.nike.com/featured_video/air-jordan-11-the-grail"" target=""_blank"">What’s your grail?</a>”  is the Air Jordan XI Concord. The nuances of that answer lie in the strength of the shoe’s historical context and the longstanding power of its design.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">In 1995, MJ shocked the world when he announced his return from retirement with a simple message — “I’m Back.”</p>","<p class=""text--p"">When he returned to the floor, he sported a #45 jersey, with #23 already hanging in the rafters. If that wasn’t enough to make fans scratch their heads, he also had something foreign on his feet. No one had seen anything like it. A white upper, while the rest of his team was wearing black? Check. A league fine for breaking uniform rules? Check. Patent leather on a basketball shoe? Check.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">But how? When the rest of the world was mourning His Airness’s departure from the court, legendary sneaker designer Tinker Hatfield remained in the kitchen cooking. He knew MJ had a love for the game that would lead him back to the hardwood. Sure enough, Jordan returned and Hatfield’s creation, the Air Jordan XI Concord, hit the court, changing the course of sneakers forever — again.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">Not only is MJ responsible for making Air Jordans part of basketball history on the court, he’s also credited with creating some of his signature line’s most iconic features. Dating back to the design of the AJ IX, MJ had been asking Hatfield and his design team to push the envelope and incorporate patent leather. His reasoning was twofold: First and foremost, the patent leather would help keep his forefoot locked-in on quick stops and cuts. MJ also predicted the patent leather would be a hit off the court, even going as far as saying people would wear them on red carpets and at other formal events. Hatfield, who admits to being initially skeptical of MJ’s suggestion, eventually bought into the idea and added it to the AJ XI. By the time people internally saw the design, they weren’t asking, “Why the shiny leather?”, they were asking why he was making another signature model for the retired MJ in the first place. He knew MJ well enough to know the AJ XI would get its time to shine.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">Jordan Brand family member Victor Oladipo in the Air Jordan XI Concord.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">Jordan Brand family member Victor Oladipo in the Air Jordan XI Concord.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">The history books will tell you MJ lost that year’s playoff series against Orlando, but they miss the most important part: MJ never lost, he learned. That series would fuel him in the off-season and inspire him to lead his team to a historic season and eventual second three-peat.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">By the time he took the floor for the following season, the word had spread. These were not just basketball shoes, they were the “Concords,” the ultimate grail. Every fan, diehard and casual, needed to have them. Whether at awards shows or on court, they made a statement wherever they appeared. Soon, it was out with the dress shoes and in with the Concords. Graduation? Lace them up. Wedding? “I do” to the XIs.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">Annually, the AJ XI is highly anticipated during the holidays. This year, the Air Jordan XI Concord gets passed to the next generation so it can change the game just like MJ did. Highlights include the original patent leather cut, Nike Air details on the insole, original box and the #45 on the heel — just like when they debuted on court.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">The <a class=""text--link"" href=""https://www.nike.com/us/en_us/c/jordan/air-jordan-11-concord"" target=""_blank"">Air Jordan XI Concord</a> releases globally in full family sizing December 8.

"<p class=""text--p"">Nike’s first collaborative project with Fear of God founder and creative director Jerry Lorenzo is highlighted by an court-ready basketball shoe, the Nike Air Fear of God 1. During the last few weeks, glimpses of the design — which incorporates a double-height Zoom Air heel unit — came through a preview of Lorenzo’s latest Fear of God offering and then appeared on the feet of NBA stars. The rollout is tactical, all part of Lorenzo’s desire to focus on the emotional element of sport. </p>","<p class=""text--p"">Jerry Lorenzo's court-ready Nike Air Fear of God 1</p>","<p class=""text--p"">Jerry Lorenzo's court-ready Nike Air Fear of God 1</p>","<p class=""text--p"">“It is a shoe that should only be judged by the emotion it gives the kid when he first sees it — however it makes him feel,” says the Los Angeles-based designer. “We live in a day and age when images are leaked left and right, and products are leaked without consideration and emotional attachments. I’m aiming to give a visceral experience whether the kid sees it first on Ben Simmons coming into the arena or worn by his favorite athletes on court.”</p>","<p class=""text--p"">Lorenzo wants to tap into a certain element of nostalgia. Not so much about <em>what</em> was worn, but <em>how</em> it was worn. He wants to awaken a spirit he deems dormant, to remind of the power sport once had in defining style. </p>","<p class=""text--p"">“In my youth…growing up in the ’80s and finishing high school in the ’90s, contrary to what's happening now, it was our superstar athletes and our pro athletes that were informing the way that we wore our street clothes,” he says. “These athletes, like Agassi and Jordan, were at the top of their game and what they wore didn’t compromise on design or beauty.”</p>","<p class=""text--p"">The visible Nike Air window houses a game-changing double stack Zoom heel.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">Working with Leo Chang, Senior Footwear Design Director, Nike Basketball, on the Nike Air Fear of God footwear allowed Lorenzo to balance his aesthetic vision and performance aspiration. Says Lorenzo of Chang, “He’s someone with a phenomenal desire, who understands innovation and performance at a high level. He’s also patient and open to not only a new designer but a new design process.” This meant a lot of patience on both sides, Lorenzo says. “In order to create a product that doesn't compromise style or innovation, you can’t make concessions to process.”</p>","<p class=""text--p"">Process is something Lorenzo says came from his athletic background in baseball and basketball. In sport, he found a foundation for how to go about life. The competitiveness that drove relative success on the field has been translated to his work as a designer.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">Recently, Lorenzo found that Nike’s 30th anniversary Just Do It campaigns affirmed the value of sport in all facets of life. Led by Colin Kaepernick, the lead spot, Dream Crazy, reminded Lorenzo that “there are people outside of sport who go about their lives through the spirit of sport.” </p>","<p class=""text--p"">And that is where he wants his collection to sit — within the soul of the wearer. </p>","<p class=""text--p"">“This is for all the kids coming up in small cities with big-city dreams,” Lorenzo concludes. “It’s about what he feels he should have, not what he thinks he should have based on what society's telling him.”</p>","<p class=""text--p"">The Nike Air Fear of God collection releases December 15. </p>"
"<p class=""text--p"">These days, the word “icon” is casually applied to everything from online video clips to sweet potato pies. By formal definition, however, an icon is ""a person who is very successful and admired” or “a widely known symbol.” The Nike <a class=""text--link"" href=""https://store.nike.com/us/en_us/pw/air-force-1-shoes/816Zoi3"" target=""_blank"">Air Force 1</a>, which debuted in 1982 and has since served as a canvas for artists and designers of all ilk, indisputably achieves the latter classification. During the decades, the AF1's iconic design has undergone subtle updates to reflect the current moment, without sacrificing its distinct DNA. In its mutability — because of it — the shoe has become a global street culture standard. See how, below. </p>"
"<p class=""text--p"">When Jordan Brand’s designers heard Union owner Chris Gibbs’s idea for a vintage-styled <a class=""text--link"" href=""https://store.nike.com/us/en_us/pw/jordan-shoes/ofqZoi3"" target=""_blank"">Air Jordan footwear</a> and apparel capsule, they were sold. They just had one question — what year?</p>","<p class=""text--p"">“We’re referencing an era, late ’80s early ’90s,” explains Gibbs, an industry veteran who grew up during that era and understands that streetwear is at its best when it captures a vibe and is unencumbered by the strict technicalities of history.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">Gibbs frequents Los Angeles-area flea markets and vintage stores and is thus familiar with the Jordan touch points of his youth and how those have aged over time. “The Jordan stuff I wear now is like if I go to a vintage market and I find some really old stuff that’s kind of patinaed or weathered in,” he says. “To me, the vintage nature of it allows you to kind of wear it outside of its intended purpose.”</p>","<p class=""text--p"">Taking Union’s reputation for elevated taste and commitment to quality fabrics and construction, the Union x Air Jordan collection carefully captures that transcendence. It pulls from a golden era in sports and streetwear — a tone evoked by the color of the wash on the apparel to the careful distressing on the <a class=""text--link"" href=""https://store.nike.com/us/en_us/pw/jordan-1-shoes/ofqZoi3Z100i"" target=""_blank"">Air Jordan Is</a>.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">The shoes also capture Gibbs’s approach with a fresh perspective on the mashup. Each fuses together classic AJI colorways with a noticeable stitch mark, evidence of a process that celebrates DYI culture and vintage hunting. Gibbs describes the inspiration as finding your most coveted pair of sneakers at the flea market, then elevating it by combining it with another pair to create a unique 1-of-1.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">For the apparel, Gibbs leaned into his past experience to balance the right look and fit. “One of the things we worked on was the drape,” said Gibbs. “I’ve learned from buying and selling a lot of high fashion that once you get through your normal silhouette of a T-shirt and a jean — garments that everybody can kind of do — there is really a lot of attention placed on how garments fall on the body.”</p>","<p class=""text--p"">Subsequently, the collection, which features <a class=""text--link"" href=""https://store.nike.com/us/en_us/pw/jordan-short-sleeve-shirts/ofqZoer"" target=""_blank"">T-shirts</a>, <a class=""text--link"" href=""https://store.nike.com/us/en_us/pw/jordan-sweatshirts-hoodies/ofqZobq"" target=""_blank"">sweatshirts</a> and <a class=""text--link"" href=""https://store.nike.com/us/en_us/pw/jordan-pants-tights/ofqZobs"" target=""_blank"">pants</a>, has been washed and distressed to perfectly match the era that Union wanted to reference. At first glance, it looks like a vintage-haul jackpot.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">The Union x Air Jordan capsule releases November 17 at select retailers. Additionally, the White, Black, Varsity Red, Grey AJI will be available on SNKRS in EMEA, Greater China and North America.

"<p class=""text--p"">The Nike Zoom Vomero +5 x A-COLD-WALL* is produced to discolor rapidly. ""It's about actually owning a product and working a product in,"" says A-COLD-WALL* designer, founder and creative director Samuel Ross. ""I find that there is quite a beauty in that.""</p>","<p class=""text--p"">How does an object change with use or over time? This question is the driving force behind Samuel Ross's work on the Nike x A–COLD–WALL* Capsule Collection, starring a radical reworking of the 2010 Nike <a class=""text--link"" href=""https://store.nike.com/us/en_us/pw/zoom-vomero-running-shoes/8yzZntjZoi3"" target=""_blank"">Zoom Vomero</a> +5. ""I am interested in how a garment ages and in taking the user on that journey. That is something I believe should be encouraged. It's much more human. It's much more dynamic as well,"" says the London-born designer.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">The Nike x A–COLD–WALL* Capsule Collection reflects this philosophy in inventive fabrics, including a technical Japanese nylon that softens with warmth and heat, and the removal of PU coatings from the Nike Zoom Vomero +5 to accelerate the aging process (manifested by a yellowing).</p>","<p class=""text--p"">The Nike x A–COLD–WALL* Parka allows for two dynamic fits. ""First is the classic overbearing overcoat with a dramatic silhouette. The other is toward an incredibly modern, and actually quite exposed and unresolved, cropped high jacket,"" says Ross.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">In this, the collection neatly follows Ross's first Nike project, a <a class=""text--link"" href=""https://news.nike.com/news/nike-af1-a-cold-wall"" target=""_blank"">Nike AF1 High</a>, which was designed to highlight the shoe’s individual components through subtle shifts in color from gray to white, reversed leathers and a disguised Swoosh (just its stitch was left). However, the employment of dynamic materials allows Ross's theory to mature as well. His ideas balance an active and static state — each piece in the collection is attractive as sculpture, but most enchanting when lived in.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">""With the Vomero, there has been this opportunity to really exalt the technology of its time and modernize the aesthetic, which is uncompromised to its purpose and function,"" says Ross. ""It's interesting to look at a shoe which has such a beautiful and polished wire frame, and then to be able to isolate individual aspects of that shoe, to really exalt the technology. It is very exciting to take something that is very beautiful and to not necessarily reinterpret but to reevaluate the product."" </p>","<p class=""text--p"">As with the AF1, Ross draws the eye to specific components in the Vomero; by manipulating the lifespan of the colors he forces continual reaction to those elements as the materials shift with wear. This creates a subtlety that juxtaposes the architectonic form of the heel counter so that the smallest details reach a harmony with the more overt styling. </p>","<p class=""text--p"">""With the garments that we produce with Nike, there is this element of sophistication weaved through the simplistic shapes, which have these small details,"" says Ross. ""Those details come down to the use of things, like Japanese nylon on the Parka, something that is initially coarse but with wear actually soften.""</p>","<p class=""text--p"">Ross describes the Nike x A–COLD–WALL* pant having ""a very stark and staunch and hostile feel.""</p>","<p class=""text--p"">Outerwear, in many ways, has been the driving force of A-COLD-WALL*. In producing coats and jackets, Ross has found opportunity to explore technical materials — like those used in this collection — and find a true communicative force for his brand ethos. With Nike, Ross also advances his approach to legwear. Take the Nike x A–COLD–WALL* pant. ""Cropping the pant and adding this tension around the back of the knee joint really gives it a very stark and staunch and hostile feel. This is the first time I have really tried to capture the energy of the outerwear in a trouser, and it pairs so well with the sneaker,"" he says.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">Within each portion of the collection, the story of an aging process is continued. The more one wears a piece in, truly lets it live, the more it changes. And with that, the Nike x A–COLD–WALL* Capsule Collection champions not just an exciting use of materials, but the raw energy and lifecycle of a product.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">The Nike x A–COLD–WALL* Capsule Collection launches November 17 exclusively in London. A global release follows November 29.</p>"

"<p class=""text--p"">A painting by artist Aaron Elvis Jupin depicts the chaos and deconstruction mentaility that Brain Dead founders Kyle Ng and Ed Davis were striving for in their Converse collaboration.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">The text on the Converse x Brain Dead Chuck 70 reads: “To see and be seen as far as the eye can see. Who Controls the Control Men. The same elsewhere.”</p>","<p class=""text--p"">Converse first applied a graphic pattern — a camouflage print — to the Chuck Taylor All Star in 1983. Glow-in-the-dark animal prints followed in 1988, a patriotic American Flag print in 1991 and since then innumerable motifs have graced sneaker culture's most recognizable silhouette.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">These archival prints form the starting point for the new collaborative project between Converse and Los Angeles-based creative collective Brain Dead. Led by founders Kyle Ng and Ed Davis, Brain Dead takes an unexpected, unique approach to retooling the iconic Chuck 70, and debuts subversive spins on archetypal garments like the MA-1. ""People always expect us to do graphic work,” says Ng. “We wanted to take a more conceptual approach with Converse. We were inspired by pattern deconstruction — we were interested in creating chaos with something that already existed.”</p>","<p class=""text--p"">The Chuck 70 is the most apparent example of this, taking a variety of prints (animal, American flag, camo) and bringing them together. If the intent was to baffle the eye, the end result was a surprise — at least for the Brain Dead crew.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">""The weird thing is, because these are classic patterns, it works together in harmony,"" says Ng.  </p>","<p class=""text--p"">What could have served as a point of tension became a point of distinction, and subsequently the backbone of the whole project, where preexisting icons are reworked with a dissident eye. This speaks to Brain Dead's creative spark, and the elasticity of the Converse brand's place in a variety of subcultures.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">""The Chuck is an icon. But the spirit of the brand is iconoclastic — that's important to the way we look at collaborations,"" says Brook Bergland, Converse Apparel Design Director.

Publicity. Wohooooow!,” stems from another sort of collaboration — the spontaneous “happenings” of 1960s avant garde artists, like Amsterdam’s Robert Jasper Grootveld. For the Patta crew, these engagements remind of a need not just for self-awareness and irony, but as Van de Waal notes, about how branded items become an act in space as well.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">Thus, a requisite boldness holds key position in the collection. Apparel was chosen as a way to mix technical elements with classics. “We wanted to make head-to-toe outerwear, but have it somehow feel like a tracksuit, so we adjusted existing Nike silhouettes to make it our own,” says Van de Waal.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">It's running sportswear, but not. Technical, but casual. Most important, it's an exercise in expressing and blending the performative elements of sport with those of style.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">Evidence of this thought comes through in the checkered suit, which is, in fact, an homage to a pioneering jazz musician<strong> </strong>who asked following his final Paris concert not “How did I play?” but “How did I look?”</p>","<p class=""text--p"">While the reference there is overt, on the other suit — the dark obsidian with bold typography — the inspiration is open-ended. The back features a large white flag, which Van de Waal explains: “The white flag bearer is historically the one who seeks to negotiate. We associate the white flag with peace, seize fire and surrender: a positive symbol in an increasingly polarizing society and public space. The white flag is also an invitation to project messages on, to color, to write on and to vandalize.”</p>","<p class=""text--p"">Fittingly, Patta broadens its collaboration with a more literal invitation, giving space to extended family to share their unique perspectives on the output as a series of campaigns that form “happenings” both physically and digitally. The work is collated in a book, created in collaboration with Linda van Deursen, featuring all 11 artists, including Bart Julius Peters, Dana Lixenberg, Oko Ebombo, Nigel Shafran, Qiu Yang, Joyce Ng, Morgan Knibbe, Vincent Van de Waal, Violette Esmeralda, Sam de Jong and Stephen Tayo. A short film by Morgan Knibbe can be viewed <a class=""text--link"" href=""https://vimeo.com/294918022/c87948e76b"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">The final flourish of the collaboration is the Air Max 90 x 95. “Both silhouettes are among our favorites,"" says Van de Waal. ""The Air Max 90 is a robust classic, and the 95 has always felt like a futuristic design; combining both forms a mix between classic and more technical design.”</p>","<p class=""text--p"">By way of Nike by You, the mix is also available for further customization, broadening (again) the nature of the collaboration and inviting all participants an opportunity to give the shoe a personal spin.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">The Nike By You Air Max 90 x 95.

"<p class=""text--p"">For Kendrick Lamar, fashion and lifestyle are synonymous. “When we are talking about lifestyle, we are talking about real lives, actual people,” he explains.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">With this focus, Lamar sees great value in bringing a real grounding to his Nike output, holding up “creativity as the only goal.” That’s apparent in the fourth Nike <a class=""text--link"" href=""https://store.nike.com/us/en_us/pw/cortez-shoes/8iqZoi3"" target=""_blank"">Cortez</a> Kenny, which takes the Cortez’s classic lines and applies a simplicity and convenience of use from an Angelino staple: the house shoe.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">“House shoes have always been part of LA culture,” says Lamar. His intent with the Kenny IV was to retain the ease and comfort of the slipper, but also allow people to still feel sleek. “The shoe is all about being able to get up and just go out in style.”</p>","<p class=""text--p"">In that vein, Lamar believes the shoe successfully attaches personal thought to classic, vintage style. What’s more, it synthesizes the values of Lamar’s home community in an unbounded way. Lamar notes that, in the shoe’s making, he was fascinated by all the possible color palettes and the many ways you can give a shoe character.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">This experience provided Lamar more insight on the process of designing and stoked his individual love for Nike anew. ""To actually sit in the room with people just as passionate as I am about creating, lets me know that Nike has always had a driven purpose,"" he says.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">Having touched digital commerce with a first-of-its-kind in arena SNKRS drop and pop-up experiences, Lamar's collaborative efforts with Nike extend well beyond the Cortez silhouette. This underscores his desire to connect with community — both physically and emotionally — by never forgetting the human element.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">""With ideas being open and honest, our possibility has no boundaries,"" Lamar says of his future with Nike.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">The Nike Cortez Kenny IV “House Shoe” releases October 14.</p>"
"<p class=""text--p"">Tom Sachs holds the Nike Mars Yard Overshoe.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">The initial need for the Nike Mars Yard Overshoe was simple: In late winter, one's feet get cold and wet. </p>","<p class=""text--p"">“The Mars Yard Overshoe, its nickname is the March Yard — for March, the worst month of the year. It is wet, your feet are wet the whole month of March,” says Tom Sachs.   </p>","<p class=""text--p"">Simple. </p>","<p class=""text--p"">But its story is more complex — one of trials and errors, questions and answers.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">Sachs learns by doing, more explicitly by making, most directly by testing. The artist, who came to fame as a sculptor and now works across a variety of media, embraces transparency in materials and the underpinnings of how things work. </p>","<p class=""text--p"">His collaborative journey with Nike, under the moniker <a class=""text--link"" href=""https://nikecraft.com"" target=""_blank"">NIKECraft</a>, is no exception. “NIKECraft is an adjective,"" says Sachs. ""It means a combination of things only Nike can produce and things only Sachs can produce. It is fifty-fifty. It is an aesthetic of transparency.""</p>","<p class=""text--p"">A full, transparent breakdown of the Nike Mars Yard Overshoe</p>","<p class=""text--p"">If Sachs learns by doing (<a class=""text--link"" href=""https://news.nike.com/news/nike-and-tom-sachs-present-tom-sachs-nikecraft"" target=""_blank"">his first Nike product arrived in 2012</a>, his experience in footwear expanding exponentially since then), he reveals areas of intrigue by questioning. This often happens by pushing the limits of an item's function. Sachs wants to know not just why something works, but how far it will work — always with unrelenting vigor. This can disrupt Nike design-thinking (Sachs is damn good at rallying a fresh perspective on solutions), but it also gives him cause to find fresh angles for himself. Again, NIKECraft is a fifty-fifty enterprise.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">“For me, the biggest challenge I’ve overcome stems from this: It is very easy to make things in the studio. We have a privilege, and an advantage, because we make things one at a time. We are like a 19th-century-style workshop. When you do things the Nike way, you engineer for the manufacturing process,"" he explains. ""As an artist, the greatest thing Nike has given me is the ability to expand my creative process and think ‘these are not constraints, these are other ways of thinking.’ It’s very valuable."" </p>","<p class=""text--p"">For example, Sachs found that, through heavy daily use, the initial Mars Yard shoe didn’t meet his expectations. </p>","<p class=""text--p"">His work as an impromptu wear-tester (now more recognized and more standardized — the Sachs studio is actually the first true urban wear-test center in Nike history) led to the <a class=""text--link"" href=""https://news.nike.com/news/tom-sachs-mars-yard-2-0"" target=""_blank"">Mars Yard 2.0</a> in 2017. This replaced the original Vectran®️ upper with a polyester warp-knit tricot mesh and inverted the tread of the outsole for more appropriate wear in urban environments.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">Sachs' latest Nike project, the Mars Yard Overshoe, is an extension of this process. It's all about working under the consideration of how the Mars Yard 2.0 performs when conditions sour. What could Sachs employ to transition his equipment? Answering for questions of weather appropriateness, it allowed frustrations (freakout-inducing cold, wet feet) to channel solutions (the employment of a Dyneema®️, a super-strong fiber often used in boat rope and sails). Experience also diversified function. While wearing the Overshoe all the way up fends off the elements, rolling it down makes inside, heated spaces tolerable. The duality serves well for the annoyances of a New York March, and allows chic navigation of street, subway and fashion week. A new tread pattern, created by a small siping at the highpoints of the outsole, is designed from a mastery of New York's winters too.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">As with all of Sachs' product, the Mars Yard Overshoe balances the raw honesty of the materials and manufacturing with the artist's touch. </p>","<p class=""text--p"">In celebration of the London premiere of Sachs’ latest film <em>Paradox Bullets, </em>a limited release of the Nike Mars Yard Overshoe will be available October 11 at DSM London. (Product available in-store only via online raffle. Conditions apply. Please follow DSM for details). A global release date for the shoe will be announced in the coming months.</p>"

"<p class=""text--p"">Few shoes embody the toughness of late ’80s basketball design like Converse's ERX.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">Famously worn by several members of Detroit's rough-and-tumble, back-to-back title-winning team, the ERX also graced the feet of rock stars and skate legends. The wearers shared a hard-working, defiant spirit, and ERX became a beacon for the bold.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">First released in 1988, the ERX had an equal balance of bulk and tech. Underfoot, Converse's Energy Wave technology provided enhanced cushioning and spurred the Energy Return Multiplier (ERX) moniker. Thirty years later, the sneaker that epitomized the over-the-top basketball style of the late 1980s is born again, and with the help of streetwear designer Don C to reflect the bold attitude and style of basketball culture today.</p>","<p class=""text--p"" style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"">CONVERSE X JUST DON ERX<br/>
The shoe — and illustration — captures the hard-nose attitude players and teams had in the '80s, when basketball was a much rougher sport.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">""There is a new generation at the helm, and they are ushering in personal memories and testimonies; this enables a rediscovery and resurgence of past models with fresh perspective,"" says Jimmy Manley, Senior Director Special Projects, Converse. ""We were taking Don C through the archives and when we got to the ERX, before we could even get into presenting it he goes, 'I remember that shoe, this is <em>the</em> shoe!' It spiraled into this rally cry to bring it back.""</p>","<p class=""text--p"">The Chicago-born designer recalled the shoe's championship pedigree — it capped a decade in which Converse athletes defined title-winning. More than that, Don C was reminded of the cross-cultural adoption it enjoyed. ""I remembered the ERX model because it had so many layers in the past,” he says. “That makes me proud, because I love when basketball becomes part of another arena.”</p>","<p class=""text--p"" style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"">Illustrator Benjamin Marra's interpretation of the Converse ERX 260 Animal, which evokes the power and energy of '80s footwear ads.</p>","<p class=""text--p"" style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"">Skateboard graphics in Marra's rendering of the Converse ERX 260 reflect an era that merged basketball and skate.</p>","<p class=""text--p"" style=""margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in"">Reminiscent of early '90s metal-album artwork, this design alludes to the counter adoption of the ERX off the court.</p>","<p class=""text--p"">Bringing back the ERX gives the brand a unique opportunity to dig into its basketball history and carve out a future of creative rebellion as Converse reclaims its heritage in the sport.

"<p class=""text--p"">Almost a decade before the founding of seminal hardcore band Suicidal Tendencies, frontman Mike Muir received his first pair of Converse as a birthday gift. </p>","<p class=""text--p"">""I think I was 10, 11 or 12,"" he recalls, which puts his first wear in the mid-70s. He was immediately attracted to Chucks for the purity of the shoe's character. ""It's one of those things that sells itself. You could identify with the shoes where we were from in California."" </p>","<p class=""text--p"">Far from being nostalgic, Muir views Converse's most enduring silhouette as perennially proper. ""A lot of people always talk about the good old days. My dad always said 'don't ever be like that,' because when you're talking about the old days, you are not in your time."" </p>","<p class=""text--p"">Suicidal Tendencies, from its '83 debut record to its latest, ""STill Cyco Punk After All These Years"" (releasing September 7) has stayed in its time. Muir attributes this to clarity of purpose. More specifically, he notes that their longevity owes a lot to avoiding prevalent trends in favor of sticking to what they like. </p>","<p class=""text--p"">""Why do some things last?"" he asks, rhetorically. ""When you get into the collective, you try to fit in, and when you are the individual you really don't care. And then people tend to follow. That's what has served us. We've done what we've liked rather than follow what others like. Going back to the early '80s, almost 40 years, there's been so many different trends. But if you get on that bus you get off your road and end up being lost.""</p>","<p class=""text--p"">Part of this philosophy stems from the establishment, early in the band's history, of a graphic identity that has become a pop culture standard. Envisioned by Ric Clayton, Venice-born artist and early member of No Mercy, the band's artwork, with its skulls and raw hand lettering, defined the group's singularity. </p>","<p class=""text--p"">This artwork forms the basis for Suicidal Tendencies' new collaborative collection with Converse. While born in the '80s, there's a timelessness that extends from the consistency Muir and the rest of the band present. ""We are very fortunate because we like where we are at and what we're doing,"" says Muir. ""We don't have a bell bottom and shag carpet stage, whereas a lot of people did things they wish they didn't.""</p>","<p class=""text--p"">For Muir, the collaboration's highlight is the Chuck 70 HI, made with a vintage canvas upper adorned with an all-over digital print and Suicidal Tendencies leather patch. ""If someone had told me in my teens I'd have a shoe, I'd have said 'no way,'"" he says. ""This would totally blow away that 16-year-old kid. That's a great thing."" </p>","<p class=""text--p"">The remaining portions of the collection — a Chuck 70 low and apparel featuring screen-printed artwork ranging from a woven poplin shirt to sweatshorts — all follow the band's long-standing aesthetic. After all, if it still works, why change it? </p>","<p class=""text--p"">The new Converse x Suicidal Tendencies collection releases September 7 on converse.com and at select retailers. </p>","<p class=""text--p"">An early release, in Converse’s hometown of Boston, will take place during a pop-up at Bodega that extends from September 6 (11am to 8pm) to September 7 (11am to 8pm), and coincides with a Suicidal Tendencies show at the House of Blues in Boston.</p>"
