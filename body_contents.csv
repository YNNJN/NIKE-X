"The story of the Nike x Tom Sachs Poncho is a reminder that good solutions take time to solidify. The product’s simplicity is deceiving. Its shapeshifting nature was perfected over the course of four years, dozens of prototypes, countless tests and innumerable hacks."
"The poncho began life in 2015 as one output of a design challenge to consider transforming apparel, and was undertaken by Jarrett Reynolds, Nike's senior design director for apparel special projects, and others. Reynolds was initially intrigued by the idea of a slimline pack complete with a quick-deploy poncho that pulled swiftly from its carry and could be easily repacked after use."
"""We used a tear-away zipper for the first incarnation. It allowed for the explosion — the forceful billowing that allowed the wearer to quickly get into the poncho — but it was really difficult to set up,"" says Reynolds."
"A collection of prototypes, including one made shortly after Sachs had an ""ah-ha"" moment on December 24, 2017."
"Despite its finicky nature, this prototype led to eight or nine other concepts, over the course of two years, each helping show proof of concept but never quite clicking, so Reynolds shared the poncho via video to a frequent Nike collaborator, Tom Sachs."
"“He was like, ‘We've got to do something with this.’ I was stoked because Tom and his team are problem-solvers, they look at things from a different perspective than we do and that’s what we needed,” says Reynolds. From there, the project blossomed into a collaborative, inventive exercise with the artist.  "
"In conversation, Sachs discusses how the poncho went from speculative exercise to NIKECRAFT project."
<strong>Nike News: NIKECRAFT is a 50-50 enterprise between Nike and Tom Sachs. How does that work when it comes to this product? </strong>
Nike News: NIKECRAFT is a 50-50 enterprise between Nike and Tom Sachs. How does that work when it comes to this product? 
<br/>
"
Tom Sachs: I want to start by reminding all of us that NIKECRAFT isn't just a brand, it's a philosophy and an approach to how we do stuff based on transparency and evidence of construction."
"Jarrett showed me the idea and expressed the problems with it — he said that it was too complicated. And I said, ‘No problem. We'll just make a movie about it.’ In doing that, we discovered it was as complicated as Jarrett suggested, so we began to work on different solutions."
"Through a lot of exploration and testing, the studio was able to find opportunity to push on an idea that had been stuck. We simplified the deployment mechanism and the repacking mechanism. We integrated things like a drag-racing inspired parachute release mechanism, an extension flap to the poncho and the fanny pack. "
"<strong>NN: When someone shows you something like Jarrett had with the breakaway zippers and this vague construct, where does your mind go? How did you get to drag racing?</strong>"
"NN: When someone shows you something like Jarrett had with the breakaway zippers and this vague construct, where does your mind go? How did you get to drag racing?"
<br/>
"
TS: When I saw his first prototype, I viewed it as a magic trick. Later, when I stumbled across the parachute release mechanism of a dragster and saw how it folded back, I saw how the problems that we were having with the complexity of the release mechanism were solved in other parts of industry. This particular mechanism, which allows a transition from fast to slow, served the purpose we needed.  "
"These transitions are reflected in the season of springtime, and March is the puberty of the seasons. And it's a very difficult month, statistically it’s when most people lose their cell phones and their keys and their wallet because they're switching coats. Also, as you get caught in the rain during this time but rarely have a raincoat with you, I thought,"
<em> why not combine all these problems?</em>
 why not combine all these problems?

TS: When I'm working in the studio — that's my athletic arena — when I wear shorts, I'm much more limber, I'm faster and I think better because I'm not constrained by fabric resistance in my knees."

NN: All of the pieces also have ceramic embellishments produced by the Sachs studio. How do you think about your own studio as part of this multi-faceted manufacturing process?
<br/>
"
TS: One of the greatest parts about working with Nike is being able to build things on a scale that the studio can never produce."
"I made some of these ceramic beads for other projects and I thought, "
"<em>well, they're pretty quick to make, </em>"

" wouldn't it be great if we could make one small part of the final product, and make many thousands?"
"We set up a little factory of beadmaking and we fired 16,000 of them that are hand formed, drilled, marked with a Swoosh and a Tom Sachs logo. And you can see the fingerprints of individuals who made them on the pieces."
"<strong>NN: Of course, other hands are involved in the process of making the pieces in the collection too. The poncho calls out Vietnam specifically. How important is the factory relationship with the collaboration of NIKECRAFT?</strong>"
"NN: Of course, other hands are involved in the process of making the pieces in the collection too. The poncho calls out Vietnam specifically. How important is the factory relationship with the collaboration of NIKECRAFT?"
<br/>
"
TS: The factory we worked with in Vietnam is, really, one the best makers that I've worked with at Nike. They didn't just blindly do what they were told. And that's a true measure of a real collaboration. Together, we all worked to produce the product, and in the spirit of transparency, I think it's really worth talking about the individuals who make the things."
Channeling all this into a finished NIKECRAFT product requires a healthy push-pull. Transparency 
<em>is</em>
is
" critical, as is sharing the underpinnings of how things work. The ingenuity of the thinking is solidified with a NIKECRAFT first: The poncho’s mechanics are patent pending."
"The poncho, which is the highlight of the NIKECRAFT Transitions collection (inclusive of the Mars Yard Overshoe and the previously mentioned down short), incorporates materials ranging from Dyneema®️ (the same super-strong fiber used on the Mars Yard Overshoe) for the trinity case behind the poncho, to those ceramic beads created by Sachs’ studio. A Fidlock buckle ensures ease of use for the waist strap, and the poncho itself was prepared from a three-layer waterproof and breathable fabric that allowed for minimal size with maximum coverage. Bold printing on the back of the garment proudly announces the location of manufacture: Vietnam."
"“The ideas in this collection — transparency of materials and of construction — are very well reflected, and I'm really honored by this body of work. They have the same value and integrity of the sculptures that I make in the studio,” says Sachs."
"And, while the products certainly could be displayed, Sachs believes strongly that they should not only be used, but also serve as an impetus to dig in and learn more. More about doing, about imagining and, above all, about process."
"The apparel elements of the NIKECRAFT Transitions collection launch April 27 in Japan to coincide with Sachs' ""Tea Ceremony"" exhibition at Tokyo Opera City Art Gallery. A global release will follow. "
"Update February 8, 2020: Apparel from the NIKECRAFT Transitions collection is available globally February 15. The assortment includes the Nike x Tom Sachs Poncho, down shorts in black and white, cap and both long and short sleeved T-shirts. "

Nike has partnered with five international icons of style to create new expressions of sport in time for the world’s biggest sporting event this summer in Japan.
"Sport-inspired collections from Yoon Ahn of AMBUSH©, Jun Takahashi of Undercover, Chitose Abe of sacai, Matthew Williams of ALYX and Virgil Abloh’s Off-White each celebrate the unique ways sport manifests. The designers equally express the inherent style of athletes and athletic apparel, and individually, each approaches the theme from different points on the sporting spectrum."
"Collectively, the initiative signifies the unifying value of sport as spark of imagination, possibility and vibrancy. Whether touching on the edges of sport culture, the rebellious spirit of barrier-breaking, the formation of new archetypes, the cutting edge of sports science research or the exuberance of fandom, all lanes combine in honor of intentional movement."
The full collections will release this summer.

"Through the uniform color and graphic visual identity, the collection also seeks to connect to the nostalgia of official-issue sports apparel often associated with youth and team sports — for many the first “exclusive” pieces ever owned."
"And because training covers all manner of sporting activity, together these elements create a uniform for fans of all sport, creating an emotional exuberance that galvanizes sports and training enthusiasts of all kinds."

The latest Nike x Pigalle Collection 
"Since 2014, Nike has worked with Parisian Stéphane Ashpool’s Pigalle in a mutual celebration of basketball’s pure cultural impact. The collaboration has generated a series of apparel and footwear collections, and also focused on supporting community-building programming by providing safe harbor for players. "
"In September 2019, an initial court in Paris became a hub for the city's players and an international symbol for the game's creative impulses. In 2019, Ashpool and Nike aim to bring the Pigalle perspective on safe sport spaces to new cities."
The Nike x Pigalle basketball court in Beijing
"""Our court in Paris birthed a community,"" says Ashpool. ""We transformed a parking lot into a place that has fostered a family and inspired people. All the subtle details that can make this magic happen were united. It was the best learning for me, and now it’s the right time to work in expanding this scheme, staying organic, authentic and focused."""
"A second Pigalle court also opened in Beijing, China in fall 2019. The location is testament to China's fervor for basketball, and the need to provide a place that can become part of the community fabric. ""The importance of the project is to give players the best outdoor facilities in order to make them comfortable enough to create something bigger,"" Ashpool says. ""We want the court to become a second home. That’s how you build a community organically around a space — we simply give them the right tools."""
"The court and surrounding space, covering an area of 600 square meters, was created with NIKE GRIND, amounting to a total of 45,000 pairs of recycled sports shoes. Throughout the year, the court will host a series of exclusive opportunities for female players — including organized activity through the city's high school basketball league and adjacent community groups. All this feeds into Ashpool's belief in basketball as a unifying force and the court as the heart of a healthy, creative community."
The new Nike x Pigalle basketball court in Mexico City
"To round out 2019, Pigalle in December again joined forces with Nike to bring two refurbished basketball courts to youth in Mexico City. Located in the Juan de la Barrera Olympic Gymnasium, these newly refurbished courts will foster and empower the basketball community in the city, while offering them a safe space to enjoy sport. "

More of the latest Nike x Pigalle Collection
"Ashpool considers his latest Nike x Pigalle Collection to be the uniform of the program, which he calls ""the power of sport to move the world forward."" It extends his individual view on ’90s-inspired apparel in a way that is also authentic to the Pigalle community — garments equally at ease on court and on street."
"Adjacent footwear channels the past and present of basketball culture and extends Ashpool's connections across NIKE, Inc. by delivering a vibrant take on the Converse Chuck 70 and a streamlined colorway of the Converse All Star Pro BB (which debuted in Paris in summer 2019). The Chuck 70 comes in two colorways, one a play on Converse's iconic natural canvas, the other featuring a gradient scheme. Both are created with a technical fuse film atop the canvas, a design element that gives the shoes an aura of future tech and classic style. This supports Ashpool's desire to merge cultures, which also comes through in his use of Converse footwear to celebrate ""the power of music to move the world forward"" (a phrase used on the white Chuck 70's rand) and promote a holistic view of the progressive value of sport and arts. "

"Kylian Mbappé’s explosive rise from Parisian schoolboy to global star is chronicled in his first Nike collection, crowned by the launch of his own Mercurial Superfly 7."
Paris Saint-Germain and French national team forward Kylian Mbappé showcases his first Nike collection. 
"In addition to the boots, the collection includes an Air Max 98, a Nike F.C. jersey, hoodie, T-shirt, hip pack, cap and a football. All are infused with the swagger Mbappé brings to the pitch and his enduring love for Bondy, the Parisian suburb he grew up in. "
"The new Bondy Dreams Mercurial Superfly combines a sleek white upper with a bold green geometric pattern that sprawls across the heel, side and front of the boot. "
The collection's Air Max 98 is topped with French flag accents.
"The color green is a prevailing theme throughout the collection. It references Bondy’s rural past, the trees on the commune’s coat of arms and the green shirts worn by AS Bondy."
The number 93 — to indicate Bondy’s location in the 93rd department (Seine-Saint-Denis) — is also heavily referenced.
The collection's football is infused with green and gold accents. 
"The collection weaves two gold stars throughout, signifying the two gold finishes by Mbappé's home country on the world's biggest football stage. "
"“Bondy is always in my heart; it’s where I found and fell in love with football,” says Mbappé. “It helped shape me as a person and as a player. I have a lot to be thankful for and it is special that Bondy is at the center of this collection. Back then I had my heroes and many of them had their own special edition Nike boot, so to join them in now having one of my own is a dream come true.”"
The Bondy Dreams Mercurial Superfly is available globally December 8 on nike.com and drops at select retailers December 11. The full Bondy Dreams collection will be sold exclusively in Europe December 8.

The cleat featured asymmetrical, off-center lacing for a larger boot-to-ball surface (which helps create a cleaner strike), as well as Zoom Air units in the outsole for optimal traction and stud pressure reduction."
"The Nike Phantom VNM Future DNA T90 pays tribute to its predecessor’s classic black, white and red colorway, and translates the 2002 cleat’s goal of precision through modern Phantom VNM technology to facilitate a powerful strike. Most notably, the new boot comes equipped with a Precision Pwr strike zone in the instep — 13 ridges set at specific angles and ascending heights to help keep the ball down and to provide a bite on its surface. "
"The boot is the third release from the Nike Football’s Future DNA Pack, which finds Nike’s current performance boots each paying homage to a classic Nike Football design, and follows the release of the "

The first Women’s Jordan OG collaboration with LA-based designer Melody Ehsani is rooted in bringing basketball to a new generation.
"“The legacy [of the Women’s Air Jordan OG] speaks for itself,” says Ehsani. “It was an exciting time in history with the inception of the WNBA and all the incredible women who were coming into the game. The shoe is really an emblem of this moment, a first in many regards.”"
"Symbolizing women’s excellence on and off the court, the designer chose an updated approach to the Air Jordan OG SP x Melody Ehsani, and through a classic lens. The black and infrared shoe is highlighted by a cherry detailing — a symbol of abundance and closely associated with the goddess of fertility."

"If Undefeated's initial Nike Air Max 90 paid direct 1990s-homage, the second effort from the LA-based outfit delivers a sneaker design version of a retro futurist approach. "
"Rugged leather from edition one is replaced by myriad materials referencing the ’90s New York street scene's adoption of technical outdoor gear. In respect for the function-first origins of those practical pieces, the shoe itself is striped down and the silhouette's features deftly reinterpreted for 2020. "
"Approach to the design began first with  fabrication, trying to mix iconic sneaker fabrics, such as nubuck leather and hairy suede, with translucent materials and technical mesh to give a modern vibe to a classic silhouette."
"This approach lead to some restructuring of the shoe's paneling to both reduce material and streamline the upper pattern. The Swoosh is thus elongated and the typical rubber ""Air Max"" marker above the Air-unit window is removed. Padding in the tongue and heel is also minimized, adding to the sleeker form. Additional details include a heel pull tab and tongue lacing reminiscent of the Nike Vomero 5. "
"The colorways are a study in contrast — a concise, all-black look highlighting the depth and texture of the build, and a blue Undefeated exclusive, honoring past Nike ACG and Running footwear and apparel."
The Undefeated exclusive colorway was inspired by the colors and hues that came out of the golden era of running shoes — the late ’80s and early ’90s — and the pop colors of outdoor sneakers that were making noise from ’92 to ’95 in NYC.
"The black Undefeated Nike Air Max 90 launches March 14 at Undefeated stores, followed by a second release March 19 on SNKRS. The Undefeated exclusive blue colorway retails on Air Max Day, March 26. "

"What bumps and bruises? Think jostling for space on a metro train, stretching out to keep a door from shutting or bouncing through a rave. The challenges of city life are nuanced and, often, discrete. A solid Air Max can help keep one comfortable through it all. "
"And, as Air Max is to the dance hall what an Oxford shirt is to American prep schools, the ISPA Air Max 720 incorporates a heel tab fastener that functions like a classic locker tab so that the shoes can be hung in glory after a night out. "

"Jordan Brand Family Member, Travis Scott, unveils Air Jordan I High OG Dior at Dior's Pre-fall 2020 show in Miami."
"During the Fall 2020 Dior men's collection, Maison Dior and Dior men Artistic Director Kim Jones revealed the first silhouette for the forthcoming Jordan Brand x Dior collection: Air Jordan I High OG Dior."
"“I love mixing together different worlds, different ideas — and Jordan Brand and Maison Dior are both emblematic of absolute excellence in their fields,"" says Jones. ""To bring them together in this special collaboration is to propose something exciting and truly new."""
"Coinciding with the 35th anniversary of the Air Jordan and celebrating the first Dior men’s collection debut in the United States, the collaborative, limited-edition Air Jordan 1 High OG underscores both the timeless appeal of the shoe and the emblematic style of Maison Dior — born always on "
<em>l’air du temps</em>
l’air du temps
", the spirit of the moment."
"With this partnership, the different cultures of America and France and of haute couture and high-performance sportswear are drawn together, unified and then blended to create a new hybrid look. The heritage of both brands is valued, respected and each is given equal gravitas. Jordan Brand’s footprint of innovation and product excellence is echoed in the élan of the Parisian ateliers of Dior men."
"“Every collaboration we do starts from a genuine connection and desire to expand the dimensions of each brand through creativity and design innovation,"" says Martin Lotti, Jordan Brand VP of Design. ""Our partnership with Maison Dior will offer a new look into the style of basketball and blend high-end streetwear with luxury fashion. We will pay homage to both brands' rich iconography and draw inspiration from our heritage.”"
Air Jordan I High OG Dior
"Made in Italy to superlative standards, the silhouette is created with the fine leather that characterizes Maison Dior’s leather goods, edge-painted and dressed in Dior Gray, a color synonymous with the Maison since its founding in 1947. A remix of the iconic Jumpman Wings logo is embossed on the upper and features the words “AIR DIOR."" The Nike Swoosh is executed in Dior Oblique jacquard, a single motif simultaneously representing both industry leaders. The same Dior motif is scaled down and laser-etched into the insoles at a 50 percent scale."
The limited-edition Air Jordan I High OG Dior sneaker will be available globally later this year in select Dior stores.

The Converse x GOLF le FLEUR* Gianno
"For the past few years, Tyler, The Creator has been steadily building with Converse. His exploration of the brand’s classics, the One Star and the Chuck 70, have allowed for experiments in color, fit, material and proportion. His latest output, the GOLF le FLEUR* Gianno, pushes the lessons learned to new boundaries. The Gianno is a new concept, engineered from the ground up, and, as should be in a true signature shoe, it is distinctly Tyler, The Creator."
"""This was an opportunity to create a build that he could have ownership and creative input to,"" says Matt Sleep, Converse’s Footwear Design Director. ""We worked to craft a design language for Tyler with nods to Converse DNA and heritage. The intent was to create something that felt contemporary and fresh, but maybe not necessarily something that looked outwardly 'Converse' at first sight."""
"Synthesizing these considerations and some of Tyler's starting points — such as influences from outdoor footwear, running and basketball — results in something unconventionally multidimensional. While there are outdoor vibes, it isn't immediately a hiking shoe. And, while the midsole drafts off the ERX series, the basketball DNA is suppressed even if it comes across more overtly elsewhere."
"Equipped with a midfoot shank, the shoe is stable. The tread pattern is rugged and its nod to Converse's ’90s basketball archive is another surprise crossover element. ""The shoe is a combination of style and function,"" says Amy Rauner, Senior Footwear Designer at Converse. ""The multidirectional non-skid, lugged outsole should work in many different conditions —whether it be biking on BMX trails or hiking in the woods."" "
"The mix of leather, nylon and suede gives the upper a rich dimensionality, while the various color choices allow Tyler to investigate both retro and contemporary influences, from current runway culture to the lineage of trail running. The sculpted, fitted upper hosts detailing, such as the mini debossed fleur motif, and reflective eye rows that weave through the design. These details provide intriguing depth to the sneaker from all angles."

"Originally released in 2002, the Nike Air Zoom Total 90 II was the perfect blend of comfort, power and precision. Made of soft KN-100 — a strong, light material — the boot’s namesake stemmed from the creation of a cleat that would support player comfort for the total 90 minutes of a match. The cleat featured asymmetrical, off-center lacing for a larger boot-to-ball surface (which helps create a cleaner strike), as well as Zoom Air units in the outsole for optimal traction and stud pressure reduction."
"The Nike Phantom VNM Future DNA T90 pays tribute to its predecessor’s classic black, white and red colorway, and translates the 2002 cleat’s goal of precision through modern Phantom VNM technology to facilitate a powerful strike. Most notably, the new boot comes equipped with a Precision Pwr strike zone in the instep — 13 ridges set at specific angles and ascending heights to help keep the ball down and to provide a bite on its surface. "
"The boot is the third release from the Nike Football’s Future DNA Pack, which finds Nike’s current performance boots each paying homage to a classic Nike Football design, and follows the release of the "

The first Women’s Jordan OG collaboration with LA-based designer Melody Ehsani is rooted in bringing basketball to a new generation.
"“The legacy [of the Women’s Air Jordan OG] speaks for itself,” says Ehsani. “It was an exciting time in history with the inception of the WNBA and all the incredible women who were coming into the game. The shoe is really an emblem of this moment, a first in many regards.”"
"Symbolizing women’s excellence on and off the court, the designer chose an updated approach to the Air Jordan OG SP x Melody Ehsani, and through a classic lens. The black and infrared shoe is highlighted by a cherry detailing — a symbol of abundance and closely associated with the goddess of fertility."

"If Undefeated's initial Nike Air Max 90 paid direct 1990s-homage, the second effort from the LA-based outfit delivers a sneaker design version of a retro futurist approach. "
"Rugged leather from edition one is replaced by myriad materials referencing the ’90s New York street scene's adoption of technical outdoor gear. In respect for the function-first origins of those practical pieces, the shoe itself is striped down and the silhouette's features deftly reinterpreted for 2020. "
"Approach to the design began first with  fabrication, trying to mix iconic sneaker fabrics, such as nubuck leather and hairy suede, with translucent materials and technical mesh to give a modern vibe to a classic silhouette."
"This approach lead to some restructuring of the shoe's paneling to both reduce material and streamline the upper pattern. The Swoosh is thus elongated and the typical rubber ""Air Max"" marker above the Air-unit window is removed. Padding in the tongue and heel is also minimized, adding to the sleeker form. Additional details include a heel pull tab and tongue lacing reminiscent of the Nike Vomero 5. "
"The colorways are a study in contrast — a concise, all-black look highlighting the depth and texture of the build, and a blue Undefeated exclusive, honoring past Nike ACG and Running footwear and apparel."
The Undefeated exclusive colorway was inspired by the colors and hues that came out of the golden era of running shoes — the late ’80s and early ’90s — and the pop colors of outdoor sneakers that were making noise from ’92 to ’95 in NYC.
"The black Undefeated Nike Air Max 90 launches March 14 at Undefeated stores, followed by a second release March 19 on SNKRS. The Undefeated exclusive blue colorway retails on Air Max Day, March 26. "

"What bumps and bruises? Think jostling for space on a metro train, stretching out to keep a door from shutting or bouncing through a rave. The challenges of city life are nuanced and, often, discrete. A solid Air Max can help keep one comfortable through it all. "
"And, as Air Max is to the dance hall what an Oxford shirt is to American prep schools, the ISPA Air Max 720 incorporates a heel tab fastener that functions like a classic locker tab so that the shoes can be hung in glory after a night out. "

Each pair serves to extend the defining spirit of the pioneering silhouette."
"The Fearless Ones collection is led by the AJI High FlyEase, which exemplifies the symbolic power of the AJI as a conduit for stories that share what it means to be fearless.

Kim maintains the original 1991 Mowabb design with modern updates that emphasize the footwear's dual personalities.
"A cult classic since its launch in 1996, the side-laced Footscape is spiced up with pink and zebra print."
"The Air Max 98 borrows from the iconoclastic Air Max 120 and is paired with red, green and yellow accents to create a sense of vibrant street elegance."
"Inspired by the silhouette's Black Cat nickname, the Air Jordan IV features the original Nike Air logo and blends on-court details with fashion-forward materials."
"A global street culture standard, the Air Force 1 has served as a canvas for aritsts and designers; Kim's take adapts the 1996 ivory snakeskin design for her Swoosh logo."
"Olivia Kim, Vice President, Creative Projects at Nordstrom, delivers fresh takes on five Nike, Inc. footwear canvases including the Nike Air Force 1, Air Mowabb, Air Footscape, Air Max 98 and Air Jordan IV, along with 16 apparel and accessory pieces for her latest Nike by Olivia Kim Collection. "
"The assembled pieces form a perfect confluence of classic Nike and Jordan designs and Olivia’s style — which is rooted in the rave and hip-hop styles defining ‘90s New York. The collection's name, ""No Cover,"" is somewhat of a double entendre to a cover charge one would associate with New York nightlife. In Kim's eyes, this collection is meant for everyone - men and women, the young and the old - in order to promote no judgements and no rules. "
"Additionally, Kim’s selection of the silhouettes is predicated on her own latent desires: While she loves New York streetwear from the 90's, at a time when a majority of the fashion-forward styles and fresh colors were made for men and she could never find anything in her size. "
"Paired with the statement footwear designs that reimagine Nike icons of the era, the collection's apparel is reminiscent of Kim’s own free-spirited teenage wardrobe. The collection features vibrant pink, volt, blue, orange and red colors, with the fleece hoodies and graphic tees featuring mini swooshes in glitter pink. "
Some of the pieces from the Nike by Olivia Kim apparel capsule include:
"""Megan Rapinoe, as a Nike and female athlete, is talking about some really important things,"" says Kim."
"""Binx is beautiful, and a strong influence to young people,"" says Kim of model Binx Walton."
"""I've always been inspired by John, because he's always pushed the boundaries in his work,"" says Kim. ""He tells simple stories in a humorous, thoughtful and provocative way."""
"""The collection, in a sense, very much matches the personalities of these people who inspire me,"" says Kim. ""It’s amazing to have Megan Rapinoe, John Waters and Binx Walton as faces of the campaign."" "
"The collection is available at Nordstrom x Nike boutiques, including the new Manhattan location at Nordstrom NYC, online at Nordstrom.com/xNike and on SNKRS on October 31, and will drop in additional North America stores and globally on November 8.

The short is made of the same material, and both fleece pieces have a unique garment wash exclusive to the collection. "

The Fall 2019 Nike Gyakusou Collection
If one considers 
"<a class=""text--link"" href=""https://www.nike.com/w/gyakusou-5ul4i"" target=""_blank"">GYAKUSOU</a>"
GYAKUSOU
" a club — the GYAKUSOU International Running Association (GIRA) — its constituents are those who value running for its intangible benefit: finding elusive peace. For fall 2019, Jun Takahashi gave this value a physical incarnation by pulling graphic inspiration for the latest GYAKUSOU collection from the bold rebel spirit of the 1970s running revolution. This was the decade that running emerged as a pursuit disconnected from competition, and the enduring energy of the time has become a rallying point for successive generations of runners."
"While Takahashi typically tackles urban running, this GYAKUSOU output considers the trail. At center is the Nike Air Zoom Pegasus 36 Trail, a crossover trainer that offers easy transition from trail to road. Surrounding the shoe is a six-piece apparel assortment that includes a rain top with zip-off hood, long-sleeve top, two short-sleeve tops, shorts and a multi-functional pant. As expected, Takahashi employs cutting-edge performance fabrics for each piece, and adds to articulated storage solutions."

"The duality of the Peg Trail shoe is captured by its two color schemes: one a classic red, white and blue expression and the other in Takahashi's now familiar mix of earthy tones. Additionally, Takahashi has placed a rose on the Peg Trail — the flower's beautiful petals and sharp thorns emblematic of the designer's balance/chaos ethos. Running, naturally, brings Takahashi balance, and in its freedom, he's able to dream up new ideas. The intent with GIRA is that it provides fuel for others to do the same."

Fast Facts on the Nike Air Zoom Pegasus 36 Trail:
1. The shapes and placements of the upper components have been informed by heat-mapping research.
"2. The shoe has overlays placed in areas where trail runners need support and reinforcement, and also leaves as open as possible areas of the foot that show a higher temperature."
"3. The lacing system, made with a strong, lightweight cable, is asymmetric to be more inline with the actual anatomy of the foot’s toe bones. "
"4. The upper’s mesh is treated with a water-repellent coating, and is made from material that allows a quick-dry and water drainage."

"Chitose Abe describes intuition as a guiding force. Things have to make sense for the sacai founder, even when creating something never-before-seen. Her latest project with Nike follows accordingly. The 11-piece collection combines the past and present of Nike’s running apparel innovations through a tour de force of strikingly-contrasted logos, patterns, colors and hemlines."
"The output channels Abe’s signature design language, which brings a new irreverence to running style and extends a partnership with Nike that began in 2014. ""sacai was just at the beginning of its foray into the international realm,” says Fraser Cooke, Special Projects Senior Director. “We saw immediately that Abe is very good at mixing up sportswear with high fashion. One of the things that we thought was really interesting about working with sacai was her way of layering and draping.” "
Belief in Abe’s work with sportswear and military icons has rung true.
"The Nike x sacai skirt is ispired by the styling of a jacket, like the Nike Windrunner, tied around the waist."
"“Often, I take the things I like from two different items of clothing and splice them together to create a whole that is bigger than the sum of its parts,"" explains Abe. ""I express the end result as a ‘hybrid.'"""
"Her capacity to deconstruct and reconstruct ideas — a hallmark of sacai — gives an unmistakable character to the current collaborative effort. The process also allows for a twofold hybridization. The first is a melding of ideas, the second in true balance of activity."
"“There has to be a genuine interest or connection in order for me to create something new and unexpected,"" says Abe. ""Another important thing is that the partnership needs to contribute exactly half the work."""
Sky Brown wearing the Nike x sacai fall 2019 apparel collection and Blazer
"A firm appreciation for Nike’s history and heritage comes through in Abe’s reimagining of running garments. She transforms the storied Windrunner into a skirt, grants an irreverence to the usually mundane half-zip and adds a refined edge to the classic Tiempo short. Her longstanding virtuosity in layering and draping is on full display."
"Nike’s mastery in shoe design is clear in making Abe’s imagined footwear fusion tangible. “We literally got two photocopied pictures of two different shoes that they folded in half and put on top of each other,” says Cooke of the beginning stages of the Nike x sacai LDWaffle."
"The resulting sneaker, a sterling example of equal contribution, certainly creates an entity greater than a simple mash-up of its components. It is symbolic of the Nike x sacai running collection as a whole — rethinking the relationship between craft, material and symbol with aplomb."
The Nike x sacai apparel drops in September alongside new colorways of the LDWaffle and Blazer.

"Bikini Bottom is officially making its debut on land — and on the basketball court. Taking Kyrie’s love for the popular cartoon show and fusing it into his shoe, the Nike Kyrie x SpongeBob SquarePants collection is ready for on-court action, and of course, jellyfishing."
"SpongeBob, Patrick Star, Squidward Tentacles, Mr. Krabs and Sandy Cheeks all have their own iteration of the shoe built off their unique characteristics. The star of the show, SpongeBob, has a version featuring a porous bright-yellow upper with a brown and red sole symbolic of his everyday outfit.

"Originally released in 2002, the Nike Air Zoom Total 90 II was the perfect blend of comfort, power and precision. Made of soft KN-100 — a strong, light material — the boot’s namesake stemmed from the creation of a cleat that would support player comfort for the total 90 minutes of a match. The cleat featured asymmetrical, off-center lacing for a larger boot-to-ball surface (which helps create a cleaner strike), as well as Zoom Air units in the outsole for optimal traction and stud pressure reduction."
"The Nike Phantom VNM Future DNA T90 pays tribute to its predecessor’s classic black, white and red colorway, and translates the 2002 cleat’s goal of precision through modern Phantom VNM technology to facilitate a powerful strike. Most notably, the new boot comes equipped with a Precision Pwr strike zone in the instep — 13 ridges set at specific angles and ascending heights to help keep the ball down and to provide a bite on its surface. "

"If Undefeated's initial Nike Air Max 90 paid direct 1990s-homage, the second effort from the LA-based outfit delivers a sneaker design version of a retro futurist approach. "
"Rugged leather from edition one is replaced by myriad materials referencing the ’90s New York street scene's adoption of technical outdoor gear. In respect for the function-first origins of those practical pieces, the shoe itself is striped down and the silhouette's features deftly reinterpreted for 2020. "
"Approach to the design began first with  fabrication, trying to mix iconic sneaker fabrics, such as nubuck leather and hairy suede, with translucent materials and technical mesh to give a modern vibe to a classic silhouette."
"This approach lead to some restructuring of the shoe's paneling to both reduce material and streamline the upper pattern. The Swoosh is thus elongated and the typical rubber ""Air Max"" marker above the Air-unit window is removed. Padding in the tongue and heel is also minimized, adding to the sleeker form. Additional details include a heel pull tab and tongue lacing reminiscent of the Nike Vomero 5. "
"The colorways are a study in contrast — a concise, all-black look highlighting the depth and texture of the build, and a blue Undefeated exclusive, honoring past Nike ACG and Running footwear and apparel."
The Undefeated exclusive colorway was inspired by the colors and hues that came out of the golden era of running shoes — the late ’80s and early ’90s — and the pop colors of outdoor sneakers that were making noise from ’92 to ’95 in NYC.
"The black Undefeated Nike Air Max 90 launches March 14 at Undefeated stores, followed by a second release March 19 on SNKRS. The Undefeated exclusive blue colorway retails on Air Max Day, March 26. "

2018 Mercurial 360
" is one of the most beloved Nike boots of all time. Of the hundreds of professional players wearing the boot, only five in the world have opted to have their Mercurials modified in any capacity. When asked to rate the boot on a scale of 1 to 10, professional players overwhelmingly rank it as a 10. The lowest score? One lonely 8."
"For a design team that starts every project by listening to the voice of the athlete, that 8 serves as a challenge. The 2019 Mercurial breaks the previous two-year cycle of innovation upgrades, working to make the boot better on a faster timeline than ever before."
"The result is a Mercurial with improvements over its predecessor in upper and plate technologies, as well as an upgraded graphic language."
"The structure of the knit upper of the 2019 Mercurial is more open than that of the 2018 version. This lessens any stiffness of the material, making it softer and more comfortable. High tenacity yarns, which are an elevated version of Nike Flywire, are then integrated into the structure for lockdown from heel to forefoot. These high tenacity yarns keep the boot from stretching out and make the 2019 Mercurial upper Nike Football’s strongest Flyknit offering to date. The upper construction also marks the first time Flywire and Flyknit have been melded into one, which adds to "

a history of firsts
 in the Mercurial line.
The addition of All Conditions Control (ACC) prevents the boot from being porous.
"Taking inspiration from speed cycling shoes that clip into pedals, the new Nike Aerotrak plate serves as the power transfer area. In conjunction with the revamped internal chassis, Nike's Aerotrak plate delivers more snap than its predecessor. It is intentionally minimalist, leaving only what is truly needed — and shaving weight off the boot in the process. The 2019 Mercurial 360 comes in under 200 grams. "
Take a look at the drop Swoosh on the boot's lateral side. The logo dips down to the stud and continues underfoot — something that can only be done with a Flyknit 360 upper construction.
"In addition, Nike’s iconic “Just Do It” slogan and the boot’s nickname, “Merc,” are added to the heel counter. “Nike Football” appears in a spectrum of languages across the plate. Consistent with the boot’s theme of lightweight speed, the lateral Swoosh has been left hollow and open-ended on the tail."

"With the Jordan Delta, Jordan Brand brings together its heritage of high-end material craftsmanship and high-tech construction methods. The shoe is designed for daily wear and is highlighted by an upper constructed with breathable mesh and augmented by lush suede overlays. The interior is seamless to prevent abrasion and ensure a smooth feel against the foot for all-day comfort. Additional padding to the collar and ergonomic tongue and heel loops further prioritize function-first design. "
"Underfoot, the Jordan Delta has full-length Nike React foam. The shoe's abstract herringbone pattern, which references a basketball mainstay for traction, delivers support and lightweight flexibility."
"Minimal branding, in the form of hand-drawn elements, allows the form and construction of the Jordan Delta to speak for itself as a modern expression of the Jordan Brand."
"The Jordan Delta SP, a Sail/Photo Blue-White version of the shoe, launches April 4 on Jordan.com and at select retailers. The Vachetta Tan colorway arrives May 14 in full family sizing, and the Black colorway releases June 6."

"Originally released in 2002, the Nike Air Zoom Total 90 II was the perfect blend of comfort, power and precision. Made of soft KN-100 — a strong, light material — the boot’s namesake stemmed from the creation of a cleat that would support player comfort for the total 90 minutes of a match. The cleat featured asymmetrical, off-center lacing for a larger boot-to-ball surface (which helps create a cleaner strike), as well as Zoom Air units in the outsole for optimal traction and stud pressure reduction."
"The Nike Phantom VNM Future DNA T90 pays tribute to its predecessor’s classic black, white and red colorway, and translates the 2002 cleat’s goal of precision through modern Phantom VNM technology to facilitate a powerful strike. Most notably, the new boot comes equipped with a Precision Pwr strike zone in the instep — 13 ridges set at specific angles and ascending heights to help keep the ball down and to provide a bite on its surface. "

The first Women’s Jordan OG collaboration with LA-based designer Melody Ehsani is rooted in bringing basketball to a new generation.
"“The legacy [of the Women’s Air Jordan OG] speaks for itself,” says Ehsani. “It was an exciting time in history with the inception of the WNBA and all the incredible women who were coming into the game. The shoe is really an emblem of this moment, a first in many regards.”"
"Symbolizing women’s excellence on and off the court, the designer chose an updated approach to the Air Jordan OG SP x Melody Ehsani, and through a classic lens.

"If Undefeated's initial Nike Air Max 90 paid direct 1990s-homage, the second effort from the LA-based outfit delivers a sneaker design version of a retro futurist approach. "
"Rugged leather from edition one is replaced by myriad materials referencing the ’90s New York street scene's adoption of technical outdoor gear. In respect for the function-first origins of those practical pieces, the shoe itself is striped down and the silhouette's features deftly reinterpreted for 2020. "
"Approach to the design began first with  fabrication, trying to mix iconic sneaker fabrics, such as nubuck leather and hairy suede, with translucent materials and technical mesh to give a modern vibe to a classic silhouette."
"This approach lead to some restructuring of the shoe's paneling to both reduce material and streamline the upper pattern. The Swoosh is thus elongated and the typical rubber ""Air Max"" marker above the Air-unit window is removed. Padding in the tongue and heel is also minimized, adding to the sleeker form. Additional details include a heel pull tab and tongue lacing reminiscent of the Nike Vomero 5. "
"The colorways are a study in contrast — a concise, all-black look highlighting the depth and texture of the build, and a blue Undefeated exclusive, honoring past Nike ACG and Running footwear and apparel."
The Undefeated exclusive colorway was inspired by the colors and hues that came out of the golden era of running shoes — the late ’80s and early ’90s — and the pop colors of outdoor sneakers that were making noise from ’92 to ’95 in NYC.
"The black Undefeated Nike Air Max 90 launches March 14 at Undefeated stores, followed by a second release March 19 on SNKRS. The Undefeated exclusive blue colorway retails on Air Max Day, March 26. "

"Nike collaborators Ahn, Kocher, Magee and Serre."
"In sport, the jersey is a garment that at once supports and celebrates brilliant performance."
"For athletes, it serves a utilitarian purpose — the jersey is a tool for their crazy dream. For the fans, the jersey serves to support their favored team and, ultimately, their community."
"As the world readies for play in France this summer, Yoon Ahn, Christelle Kocher, Erin Magee and Marine Serre transform the jersey in their vision, proving that while a jersey need not take a standard form, it can become a standard reminder of the unifying power of sport."
Each designer has also matched a bra with their jersey. Here they describe the intent behind their respective concepts:
Yoon Ahn’s Nike x AMBUSH® jersey shines a spotlight on the diversity and culture that is celebrated on the international tournament stage.
"My Nike x AMBUSH® jersey is a unisex hybrid football jersey inspired by the Happi coat, a traditional Japanese straight-sleeved coat. I chose the Happi coat because, although we are celebrating the tournament and the incredible female players, I believe it is just as important for the fans, for everyone to have a universal piece to celebrate in."
"The Nike x Koché jersey explores fabric, color and cut to produce an elegant asymmetry."
"The idea was to give the feeling of movement and positive energy. I created this dress by reconstructing the soccer jersey around the female body. The result is a dress that can be worn by a girl who plays, dances or moves in the city."
Magee celebrates the ground-breaking U.S. Women’s National teams of the late ‘90s with a match-ready Nike Stadium jersey featuring the USA federation crest. 
"I wanted this jersey to be sport first, fashion second. It’s meant to celebrate the incredible victorious history of the USWNT by drawing attention to the woman namesake of the iconic sportswear company itself: Nike the Goddess of Victory."
"Serre presents a slender, articulated jersey designed to be worn over a printed body suit."
The focus of my designs is always hybridity and adapting to daily life. It’s important to create a purposeful line that makes a female feel good without compromising the style.

"The second collaborative capsule from Converse and TakahiroMiyashita TheSoloist. takes inspiration from the storied Jack Purcell, which originally released in 1933 and, despite its smiley face bumper, has a bit of a rebellious streak."
"The sneakers's dual character — part sport classic, part cultural classic — is conveyed by Takahiro Miyashita's employment of a mismatched ‘Stars and Bars’ graphic canvas (a print originally introduced by Converse in 1991) and a vertical utility zipper framed by asymmetrical lacing. It is an appropriately respectful yet defiant approach to transforming the silhouette, fully in keeping with Takahiro's ingenuity."
"The TakahiroMiyashita TheSoloist. founder riffs on vintage Americana to unpack the nuanced style directives of the silhouette. A lightweight GORE-TEX® jacket, short-sleeve T-shirt and hoodie feature stylized zips, eyelets and lacing reminiscent of the Jack Purcell, while each host hidden discovery elements that allow for packable transformation or utilitarian styling. "

"The best collaborations stem from unabashed passion. This is true of the Patta x Jordan collection, inclusive of the Air Jordan VII “Patta,” a track suit, shorts, T-shirt and bucket hat, which marks the first time Jordan Brand has partnered with a European brand. TEAM PATTA uses the relationship as a conduit for relaying personal nostalgia about the Jordan VII and the early '90s to their current audience."
"For Patta’s Guillaume Schmidt and Vincent van de Waal, the Jordan VII was the logical starting point for working with Jordan Brand. Launched in ’92, and subsequently eternally tied to that summer’s USA Basketball team, the Jordan VII arrived at a transformative point in both men’s youth and their respective interest in the culture they live and work within."
"“It was a golden era for hip-hop. It was a big time for me, a lot of very important albums that I carry with me still came out between '92 and '96. And aesthetically, those years had such strong, colorful and connected relationship to black empowerment. The VII also has a reference to Africa,” says Guillaume, a native of Suriname who grew up an hour from Amsterdam in basketball-crazed's Hertogenbosch."
"Vincent, Patta’s creative director, was drawn to the Jordan VII’s elegant shape and the minimal marking (it was the first in the Jordan line without any Nike branding). Today, Vincent is effusive about the shoe, stating, “It is my all-time favorite.”"
"The footwear itself plays only part of the story, as both Guillaume and Vincent recognized immediately the power of the full package surrounding the VII. “The VII apparel was out of this world. The products that we worked on come straight from a short Jordan clip from Barcelona that became super famous. It features a segment where Michael walks past a huge billboard of himself where he's got the shoes on, and that image has been forever etched in my memory,” says Guillaume."
"Reviving the pattern of those original garments, Patta is also able to tie in its branding subtly though incorporation of “TEAM PATTA” word marks. “We see ourselves as a strong team where everybody has their place, so the concept of ‘TEAM PATTA’ has always been important to our history,” says Vincent."
"The Patta x Jordan Collection releases May 18 at Patta’s Amsterdam and London locations, as well as on "

Nike x UNDERCOVER SU19 Collection
"For almost a decade, Jun Takahashi has worked with Nike on the running-focused Gyakusou line, which takes inspiration from his own sporting interest and probes the interplay of fluid movement, fixed environment and the meditative value of running. Beginning this summer, Takahashi extends his relationship with Nike by way of a formal collaboration with his brand, UNDERCOVER."
"“With Nike, we are able to explore technical materials and fabrications that allow for new investigations of UNDERCOVER's design principles,” says Takahashi."
"With the debut of Nike x UNDERCOVER, Takahashi challenges two things: static volume and utility norms."
"Each of the four garments in the collection allows for adjustments to fit via Velcro tabs. For example, the long-sleeve top can be modified for width, while the T-shirt allows for fine-tuning of the arm holes. This creates opportunities to personalize drape and scale, alternately loose and oversized or streamlined."
"Takahashi’s bold approach to carrying personal essentials gives each garment a distinct functional value. Most radically, the hood of the tracksuit functions as a pocket and the body has zippered mesh pockets at the back to complement the more traditional kangaroo front pocket. The tracksuit’s trouser has both cargo pockets and a zippered mesh pouch at the rear. Both long-sleeve top and T-shirt also incorporate mesh."
"Subtle “CHAOS BALANCE” text, a longstanding UNDERCOVER motif, embellish each garment and signify the brand’s philosophy of marrying raw energy and technical expertise."
The Nike x UNDERCOVER Daybreak
"Debuted during UNDERCOVERS's spring/summer 2019 Paris runway show, Takashi's examination of the Nike Daybreak completes the assortment. The shoe will release in seven colorways."
Global release of the inaugural Nike x UNDERCOVER collection begins June 7.

Fashion designer Chitose Abe of sacai approaches collaborations with a distinct clarity: She looks to find a genuine connection that allows her to create something new and unexpected. Her design itself balances two ideas: stability and betrayal. Abe's aim is to simultaneously give light to the familiar and the new.
"She does this with the Nike x sacai LDWaffle and Blazer Mid, both of which debuted at sacai's SS19 runway show in Paris in June 2018. For example, Abe employs her signature ethos on the Nike x sacai LDWaffle by pulling two heritage Nike silhouettes into a single hybrid form. The ""betrayal"" elements of this exercise include doubled elements, like the Swoosh and tongue, as well as elongated midsoles. Abe delivers ""stability"" through the familiar retro color scheme."

Nike x CPFM VaporMax 19
"Debuted on Air Max Day, the Nike x Cactus Plant Flea Market VaporMax 2019 reimagines the future-forward silhouette with a deft balance of its inherent technicality and CPFM's two-fold design intent."
"First, by introducing 3D puff lettering, stitched taping, mismatched coloring and a wobbly Swoosh (formed by garden wiring), the VaporMax takes a hand-made feel. This human quality connects to the second intent: highlighting the natural beauty of “in-between time,” the moments in dawn and dusk that define a city’s particular color field. This concept, specifically the optical phenomenon of a green flash — a sliver of green that appears upon the crest of the sun as it merges with the horizon — inspired the color choices."

"The backward Nike Swoosh takes its shape from the brand’s box logo, because the traditional AJI Swoosh extends into the heel and never has an end point."
"Travis Scott lists the Air Jordan I among his all-time favorite sneakers. Given the chance to work with the silhouette, he was determined reintroduce it with a new perspective. The Travis Scott Air Jordan I High OG achieves his goal with details like a backward Nike Swoosh, hidden heel pocket and subtle Cactus Jack branding — along with a touch of childhood memory."
"""These Jordan 1s are just a fresher version of my old play shoes,” says Scott. “The colors are from tones and textures of what I saw growing up and remind me of my backyard and playing outside."""
"To create the collar pocket, an AJI sample was dissected to determine which area would be most practical. When the lining was cut, it was discovered that the collar created a natural pocket that could be sealed with a Velcro enclosing."
"Scott’s individual touches extend to the minimal Cactus Jack branding, which is employed so as not to overpower the minimal design of the shoe. These understated elements come via the embossed heel, tongue patch and an inner mid-panel that all feature Scott’s hand-sketched logos."
"Scott’s debut apparel collection with Jordan Brand complements the Air Jordan I. This collection re-imagines Jumpman essentials — fleece hoodie, fleece shorts, a tracksuit and tees — with Cactus Jack colors and imagery."
"“The apparel collection is just another form of expression and design. It brings the creative of the shoe to other lifestyles pieces for the brand,” says Scott."

"All innovative in their approach to apparel, Koché, Feng Chen Wang and Faith Connexion have partnered with Converse on a new collaborative concept for women."
The individual pieces of Converse by Koché x Feng Chen Wang x Faith Connexion form a full multi-designer-collaborated collection.
"Helmed by Christelle Kocher, Koché balances a streetwear sensibility with unparalleled couture know-how. With Converse, Kocher's proficiency in patchwork construction gives classic sport silhouettes — like the polo shirt, track jacket and track pant — a distinctly feminine edge. Kocher's apparel pieces are complimented by a three shoes: a Rina, Mary Jane and Jack Purcell"
"Chinese-born, London-based menswear Feng Chen Wang's first foray into womenswear comes via a sharp blend of basketball and streetstyle. Extrapolating from the rough-and-tumble ERX 260 and the iconic Chuck 70, she plays off a multi-decade hoops history through explorations of the track suit, windbreaker and hoodie."
"Based in Paris, Faith Connexion serves as a laboratory for young talent. The collective engages with Converse's unique camouflage prints — referencing the brand's outdoor and military heritage — creating a balance of elegant silhouettes and street-inspired graphics. New takes on the Run Star, One Star Mid and One Star Ox complete Faith Connexion's work."
Converse by Koché x Feng Chen Wang x Faith Connexion launches April 26 at converse.com.

Nike Air Fear of God Raid
"Jerry Lorenzo saw the Nike Air Raid for the first time as a high school sophomore when a fellow student came into class with it on. The shoe itself was an immediate object of desire. Lorenzo loved the gray and black color scheme, he said, and the nuances of the geometric patterns and the impact of the crossed straps. He noted there was a positive, pro-Black feeling about it. It was the first Nike shoe outside of Jordan he had an emotional connection to."
"""When the kid walked in the classroom with the Air Raid, no one told me that I was supposed to like the Air Raid. I was just drawn to it, the design, the colors. It was like, oh my God, what is "
<em>that</em>
that
"?"" Lorenzo recalls. ""It became interconnected with all these other real emotional things that were happening at the time of the shoe."""
"As he learned more about sneaker culture, Lorenzo discovered that the Raid was designed for playground use. It wasn’t strictly off-court, instead it was an early channeling of basketball culture into a physical manifestation. The Raid was a vibe — sport and spirit in fashionable unison."
<strong>Here’s where sport and style carry a different groove though</strong>
Here’s where sport and style carry a different groove though
: Lorenzo’s most memorable collegiate sporting experience doesn’t come from play but from a halftime show.
"1998, six years after the Air Raid released but still within the time frame of the cultural epoch it was birthed in, Lorenzo was at Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University (FAMU), his alma matter, for homecoming. The traditional half-time battle of the bands struck off with the opposition re-purposing a Miami bass banger."
"""Everyone went crazy, and we were just so demoralized. We were just like, what are we going to do? How can we top that?"" he remembers. "
"FAMU's band comes on and throws a curveball. It didn't play a current hit. Nor did it pull in a prior fan favorite. Instead, the band ripped into the horn section from a deep cut of an Atlanta duo’s recently released third album. The stadium exploded. The visceral energy of sport in action — a common language utilized as an ignition point. It was a reminder that the experience of sport is multifaceted."
"""It was the emotion of that feeling, the soul of that feeling — watching the stadium being rocked side to side that serves as a measuring stick of what I'm trying to do emotionally every time through product,"" says Lorenzo."
"Nike Air Fear of God reversible jersey, Nike Air Fear of God woven pant, Nike Air Fear of God Raid worn by WNBA player Diamond DeShields of the Chicago Sky"
"As the lead element of the second Nike Air Fear of God release, the Nike Air Fear of God Raid, extends the notion of spirit from the court to the larger cultural milieu around the game. It reminds that the aural and the visual are equally important in defining the tenor of time."
Because of that the Nike Air Raid is a perfect conduit for Lorenzo's

The latest of these come from a quartet of intriguing and ambitious Air Max designs from Tokyo-based Atmos, Edison Chen's venerable CLOT, New York's Heron Preston and the elusive Cactus Plant Flea Market.

Harlem-born A$AP Nast has developed his singular aesthetic through an expressive bend of fashion concepts and hip-hop style. 
"Nast worked with Converse footwear designers Julian Guzman and Matt Sleep to give the Jack a utilitarian vibe appropriately honoring his love for the outdoors. This is achieved through a heightening of the shoe's rubber overlays, which adds dimension and durability to the heritage canvas upper. "
"“The silhouette is functional, durable. It’s intriguing. I wanted to craft a style that could be worn every day,” says Nast. "
"Very rarely does a shoe transcend generations the way the Jack Purcell has done. Released as a badminton shoe in 1933, it gained a second life as a lifestyle shoe in the mid-60s and has since become a bonafide casual classic. "
"""At the time of its introduction, the Jack Purcell had tremendous impact but limited reach given its positioning as a badminton sneaker,” notes Jimmy Manley, Senior Director of Special Projects at Converse.  “Because it has since crossed over to the lifestyle space, its reach today is much broader. The silhouette is sure to experience yet another cultural refresh, thanks to Nast’s influence with a diverse range of youthful consumers.”"
"The Converse x A$AP Nast collection also includes two Crew Sweatshirts, matching Crew Sweatpants and a set of vintage wordmark T-shirts that feature a printed “JP” graphic (short for Jack Purcell) on the front panel, and words Nast considers integral to Converse’s place in culture listed on the back panel. "

Mr. Link in the Missing Link x Nike Air Max Susan
"Mr. Link, the protagonist of LAIKA's new film, ""Missing Link,"" is the inspiration behind the latest collaboration between Nike and the animation studio. In the story, Mr. Link, a lovable creature, supports Sir Lionel Frost, the world's greatest monster chaser, on a globetrotting adventure to find a remnant of Mr. Link’s primitive ancestry. The Missing Link x Nike Air Max Susan, designed by Nike VP of Advanced Concepts, Tinker Hatfield, and former animator Michael Berger, translates the materials and textures of Mr. Link's plaid suit, created by LAIKA costume designer Deborah Cook, to a Nike Air Max 1."
"""Costume isn't a separate entity from character design, it's very much intrinsic,"" says Deborah Cook. ""If Mr. Link was wearing completely different clothes, you'd read him in a very, very different way."""
"Cook explains that Mr. Link's aesthetic plays up the character's Pacific Northwest roots and balances it with a desire to serve as playful foil to the urbane Frost. This is also evident in the shoe's leather-wrapped midsole, cuff links and kurim fur tufts on the tongue that lend a gleefully haphazard elegance to the silhouette."

Production of the Missing Link x Nike Air Max Susan and its unique elements benefit from a blend of LAIKA's specialty in 3D printing (the company was awarded a Scientific and Engineering Oscar® plaque for its innovation in 3D printing in 2016) and Nike's rapid prototyping.
The team also used LAIKA's Stratasys PolyJet-based 3D printing solutions to create an exclusive pair of the Missing Link x Nike Air Max Susan for Mr. Link.
"""The Air Max 1 has always been a really uplifting, happy design. When I saw the film, I immediately felt Mr. Link was instantly lovable — he's happy-go-lucky, the type to stop and smell the flowers. So, he's got a certain chill that for me made sense with the silhouette,"" says Hatfield."
"Nike has a long-time partnership with the LAIKA studio, and while many shoes have been produced in tandem over the years, the Missing Link x Nike Air Max Susan is the first to release commercially."

"Shanghai streetwear boutique DOE, takes its name from the moniker for the anonymous or unknown person: John Doe. Celebrating its 5th anniversary, Converse's collaboration with DOE connects the name with the traditional Eastern philosophy ""empty your mind, be formless."" "
"""I wanted to celebrate our 5-year anniversary of the shop by reflecting DOE’s attitude into the design details for the Chuck 70 and Jack Purcell. In Western culture, DOE identifies as anyone and everyone, which is echoed in our choice of the silhouettes, which are worn and loved by so many across China,” says Terry Zhu, co-founder of DOE. "
"The capsule collection is highlighted by the Chuck 70 and Jack Purcell, both of rich carry cubed graphics, inspired by ""suprematism,"" a challenge to traditional figurative art, and prepared in an engineered jacquard knit. A woodgrain print features in the sockliner (a reference to the wooden anniversary marked by 5 years). A track jacket, track pant and T-shirt complete the offerings.  "

Tyler's intent is to allow the genderless garment to serve as a foundational piece — one that can be styled with a high degree of personalization. "
"“With Tyler's twist, the suit balances vintage and modern vibes. It demonstrates his ability to continue to push Converse apparel into new spaces,” says Brook Bergland, Converse Apparel Design Director."

"Some people run fast. Others run far. Some do both. Some run races — against time, another person or even the mind. Many cherish solo moments on the open road while just as many prefer to share the experience with fellow harriers. Running can energize; but it can calm, too. "
"For UNDERCOVER founder Jun Takahashi, running is a source of creativity — a meditative exercise that allows him to contemplate ideas for his next collection and visualize them."
"With his Gyakusou collections, now almost 10 years deep, Takahashi's intent is to blend high-performance wear with the urban landscape. This forms, in some respect, a symbiosis between fluid movement and static environment, a desire held for all of his output."
"""I intentionally include earthy colors. It is important to bring together my aesthetics with Nike’s functionality,"" he notes. ​​"

"The Transform JKT, as the name suggests, “transforms” the jacket by unzipping the front and stuffing the top part of the jacket into its pocket. The Gyakusou version of the jacket gives the lightweight woven outer that protects runners from wind and rain a distinct color and graphic treatment, while the soft Dri-Fit base is designed to wick sweat.

"Matthew Williams, founder of 1017 ALYX 9SM, says he is fascinated by opportunities afforded by Nike's varied suite of digital design tools. His collections embody his belief that the intersection of human imagination and technology points to an exciting future. Of course, he knows that data alone doesn't design, but it certainly deepens relationships with the body."
"<a class=""text--link"" href=""https://news.nike.com/news/nike-matthew-williams-alyx"" target=""_blank"">Williams' first Nike collection</a>"
Williams' first Nike collection
" explored the ways data is informing new manufacturing methods of the T-shirt (heat and sweat maps transformed to structural patterns). For his second capsule, he focused on how data reveals things that are normally unseen."
"""For this collection, we used computational algorithms to create the camouflage pattern,"" he says. Camouflage, of course, traditionally derives from nature. With data, Williams is able to toy with hidden-in-plain-sight natural shapes to arrive at a new motif."
"The pattern isn't just trend-driven (Williams views camouflage as season-less and always relevant) but also appropriate to one of the functional purposes of the products: equipping athletes for what Williams describes as ""really hardcore outdoor training."" He's thinking of things like flipping tires, hauling sandbags uphill and traversing obstacle courses. But, understanding holistic training, he's also thinking adaptability between varied fitness pursuits — lifting, sprinting and taking group classes."
"To that end, there's a mix of "

", two-in-one pants, utility vests and detachable hoods. Everything is about multi-functional use. Data also informs the paneling on the tops. “When you're running, you get wet mainly the top of your shoulders, so we ensured rain coverage in that spot,"" Williams explains."
An added touch of humanity comes in the accessories range. Athletes need socks and underwear. Williams dutifully provides both.

The Converse x JW Anderson Run Star Hike
"Jonathan Anderson’s latest collaboration with Converse began with an established desire — merge a Chuck Taylor with a runner — and quickly evolved as a study in blending a Converse icon with a new, very different Converse silhouette. The result, the Converse x JW Anderson Run Star Hike, drew immediate attention when it debuted during the designer’s Spring/Summer 2019 Collection show last September in London."
"In principle, the silhouette is a declaration on contemporary mash-up culture, while in practice, it's a deft articulation of gamesome exploration of proportion and stance."
"“Contrasting proportions have always been part of my design aesthetic. When I approached this latest Converse, I was looking to re-create the same aesthetic by pairing the sole of a Run Star with the classic Chuck Taylor to emphasize the proportions,” says Anderson."
This approach presented a challenge in engineering: how to retain integrity of individual parts and still present a strong catalyst for visceral reaction.
"Thus, building the Converse x JW Anderson Run Star Hike required some ingenuity in design. Anderson didn't touch the upper; it rounds the foot with the same graceful, narrow sweep as it did in the '70s. He accentuated this simple shaping by using the tooling of the "
"<a class=""text--link"" href=""https://news.nike.com/footwear/converse-run-star"" target=""_blank"">Converse Run Star</a>"
Converse Run Star
", a heritage-style, injection-molded running shoe. It's the antithesis of the Chuck in terms of chunk and presents an intriguing stack height. Scale was also added through the addition of a sawtooth tread, effectively forming a three-part shoe (upper, midsole, outsole) wherein each portion can be read easily from distance.   "
The date “1917” honors the birth of the All-Star.
.........................................................
"The Converse x P.A.M. collection taps the versatility and cross-cultural adoption of the Chuck 70 across decades to create a sneaker that muses function with new world styling, allowing the wearer to adapt and interpret it on their own."
"When unzipped, the silhouette transforms into a canvas slip-on Chuck 70 with a dual-branded tongue patch and gold side panel."
Perks and Mini (P.A.M.) co-founders Misha Hollenbach and Shauna Toohey believe even the most classic of silhouettes benefit from mutations in form — as long as its physical transformation contemplates the future.
"“Mutation is about evolution and the idea of what’s to come, what the future could be. It is not a rigid or singular way of thinking. It is an openness. We must adapt,"" say the designers."
"The Paris-based lifestyle brand taps into that theme with its collaborative take on the Chuck 70 and select Converse apparel. The collection is highlighted by the sneaker, which is engineered with PrimaLoft®, a thermal material from the '80s, to form an upper that can be fully removed with a zipper.  When unzipped, the silhouette mutates into a canvas slip-on Chuck 70 with a dual-branded tongue patch and gold side panel."
"The connected apparel includes a Track Pant, Hoodie, Long and Short-Sleeve Shirt and a reversible Quilted Bomber Jacket that's completely crafted in PrimaLoft® with functional side pockets, graphic sleeve artwork and a heat transfer graphic on the back."

"The world's best finishers — the likes of American Alex Morgan and Englishman Harry Kane — have something in common: Each knows that for every perfect, thrilling set ball goal, there are dozens of toe taps, heel flicks and hits off the outside of the foot. The value on the score sheet is the same, and the most proficient scorers come equipped with a nose for a goal and a litany of skills for converting their opportunities."
"""My finishing is a balance between power and placement,"" says USWNT star Alex Morgan. ""It depends where I am in the box, but I'd say my focus is usually 60/40 accuracy versus power.” "
That style of finishing is why the design of the

" features a series of textured zones to facilitate a powerful strike, but with an understanding that all of the power in the world won’t score without the accuracy to keep the shot on goal. This emphasis is most evident in the instep’s Precision Pwr strike zone."
The 13 ridges of the instep's Precision Pwr strike zone are set at specific angles and ascending heights to help keep the ball down if it is mishit and to provide bite on the ball.
"The plate, which takes inspiration from Nike Free, is flexible in the forefoot for toeing off the ground with torque for sharp cuts."
"PhantomVNM increases the strike zone area by covering the laces, giving PhantomVNM a 30-percent larger strike zone than "

"“We teamed up with our research lab to utilize a robotic leg to test strikes from a variety of angles with urethane injected ‘blades’ across the instep,” notes Jeongwoo Lee, Senior Design Director for Nike Football Footwear. “This enabled us to go deep statistically on the impact that the various blade iterations had on accuracy, elevation, power and spin. The lab data helped us land on the exact specifications of Precision Pwr strike zone built for finishers.”"

", a track suit, a jersey, a cap and a vest. "
"""In the early 2000s, a Nike Tracksuit paired with Nike Air max was the uniform of the London Streets. We started C.E. a decade later, and though we were in Tokyo, images from that time and place have been consistently with us,"" says Toby Feltwell. ""We looked at this opportunity to work with Nike as a way to interact with these images more directly. We are engaging in a sort of time travel. The project with Nike has allowed us to work in the present to redesign our past."""
"The articulation of the Nike x C.E. tracksuit pant is evidence of this action. A cinching behind the knee changes the silhouette from a straight leg to a more attractive, updated fit. As Feltwell notes, C.E.'s approach is not an exercise in authenticity. ""We're not directly appropriating stuff, but we're seeing various things that interest us and trying to highlight them,"" he says."
"This theme carries into the patterns and word play that C.E. has become synonymous with. Rather than spoon feed the obvious, they're pleased to offer an entry point for discovery — nothing ventured, nothing gained — that bucks easy access trends."
"""There's always been things out there where you felt that the brand had left behind a trail of bread crumbs that allowed you to go on a path to discover something that you wouldn't have known about otherwise. We feel that we're carrying on a tradition in that sense,"" says Feltwell."
The Nike x Cav Empt collection releases January 5 at Cav Empt's Tokyo store and on cavempt.com. A wider release follows on January 10.

Vince Staples' take on the Convese Thunderbolt
It was a search through the Converse archives where SoCal-born Vince Staples explored a question that so often serves as a baseline for his songwriting: What happens when intended function is overridden by modern-day adoption?
"Staples found a starting point in the Converse Thunderbolt, and he uses the sometimes outlandish appropriation of traditional running gear to drive his creative collaboration with the brand."
A varsity jacket is among three pieces of apparel within Staples' new collection
"On the Thunderbolt, natural, transparent colors and textures are juxtaposed with contrast stitching, high gloss/reflective accents and a graphical language representative of modern Californian aesthetics. This graphic language is most prominent in the collection’s “RUN” graphic, crafted in an archived ‘80s style font and 3D printed onto the heel of the sneaker. "
"The accompanying three-piece apparel collection consists of a track pant, crew and varsity jacket, each of which have distinctive stitch piping.  The apparel is further unified by a key color, vibrant orange, which is a nod to Vince’s first collection with Converse and contrasts the collection’s milder and darker tones."
The Converse x Vince Staples Thunderbolt and associated apparel drops December 18 on converse.com and at select retailers.

"Martine Rose began designing her version of the Nike Air Monarch by fitting a size 18 upper to size 9 tooling, resulting in this extraordinary shape."
"“I have never been interested in fashion. I've always been interested in how people interact with clothes,” says London-based menswear designer Martine Rose."
"Her first collaboration with Nike, a capsule featuring tracksuits, football jerseys and a completely re-articulated Nike Air Monarch, is indicative of this fascination. It plays, as much of Rose’s work does, on distorted proportion. Similarly, it follows the ethos of her design: finding things that appear ordinary but have something extraordinary about them and transforming those into items that are, in Rose’s words, “really quite exceptional.”"
"Most often, the transformation takes place in experimenting with form fit. It is always also an exercise in rule breaking and clashing context."
"“When we started, we never just followed the rules, really because our access was blocked. For one reason or another we had to find different ways to show,” says Rose. And though her brand now has staged shows in local London markets and rock-climbing gyms, when it came to her Nike collaboration, Rose revisited her roots and opted for a clandestine collection launch last week. The location? Craig’s List — a digital space far removed from hype cycle norms."
"As for the clashing contexts, here are the key elements behind the formation of Rose’s Nike collaboration:"
"Excess material on the track pant is framed by a pleat on the wearer’s right leg. The jacquard football jersey is highlighted by an elongated striped neck rib, and its oversized fit is augmented with excess volume pleated into the sleeve."
"For the tracksuit and football shirt, the process began with a spot of imagination — a seven-foot spot, to be exact. “Basketball players are superhuman — their bodies have formed in different ways because of their profession. We looked at a lot of players and their proportions. We then re-imagined their clothes on average-size people. For example, if I were wearing one of their tracksuits, I would have to repurpose it in order to fit my proportions; I’d have to tuck the seams,” explains Rose."
"“It was very intentional to use the Monarch as the silhouette, being a very American shoe, and then put it with the very English silhouette of the tracksuit,” says Rose."
"To give that very ordinary shoe a very extraordinary shape, Rose relied on Nike’s undisputed expertise in footwear. “Collaborations are about communication. We wanted some of the forms to spill over the base and we wanted the heel on the outfit to be further out than the sole…things we were initially told couldn't be done,” she says. “But everyone kept on pushing and we ended up developing these new shapes and ideas.”"
"The shape itself follows on the same imaginative exercise as the apparel, but with more even experimentation — beginning with fitting a size 18 upper to size 9 tooling. Bringing this vision to commercial life required inventive development. Thus, Rose’s Air Monarch was built as a series of molds that were topped with stretched synthetic leather. Only one shoe has a similar construction, itself an American standard: the Nike Foamposite."
"Though ubiquitous, silhouettes from sport are now as common on the high street as on a Paris runway. For Rose, this speaks less to trend and more to spiritual connection."

"Yoon Ahn, celebrated jewelry designer and one half of the brand AMBUSH®, is in nearly constant motion. Between her base of Tokyo and her work in Paris, she operates on a hectic schedule by anyone's standards. This pace inevitably defines her relationship with what she wears. ""When you live a busy lifestyle, the last thing you want is to think about how your clothes are uncomfortable or not functional,"" she says.  "
"What Yoon says she does want to think about is her approach to and the refinement of her craft, of which she considers sport to be an essential influence, and finds parallels between an athlete's preparation and definition of commitment. "
"""It's about a certain mentality — the commitment to be best at what you're doing,"" she explains. ""There are two things: the mental part, and the physical. Obviously, the mental involves a lot of skill sets that I need to work on. But with that, there is a need to build the strength to repeat them."""

"“These guys are unbelievable creatives. What I love is that Concepts has always identified specific cultural touchpoints and pushed things that make them their own,” says Irving. "
"With Irving, the Concepts idea draws from the all-seeing eye within the athlete’s Hamsa hand tattoo. Rather than replicate it (given that the tattoo is a major theme of the KYRIE 5 heel counter and box), Point decided to dig into the history of Egypt’s ancient pyramids. “I found out the mortar used remains a mystery to scientists — they still can't figure how it stuck together, but it's some of the strongest stuff ever made. I learned that the limestone glowing in the sun made the pyramids glow brighter than a diamond. And one thing that really got me: there was a 20-ton door on one of the pyramids that was so precise, you can’t squeeze a credit card through the seams — but it can be opened with one hand,” he says. "
"These facts, figures and myths combine in the Concepts x KYRIE 5 Ikhet to form an intriguing play of color and modeling. They give dimension to the shoe’s distinctive flytrap lacing, which is imbued with the type of nuances Point and team are known for."
"“It's a great collaboration with great people behind it who are thinking outside of the box. That's what you need sometimes in order to create great things,"" says Irving. ""Just having a shoe with Concepts is awesome. People are like, ‘Wait. This is a rare Nike shoe?’ You're damn right it is.”"
The purple sole captures the color of the sunset against the pyramids.

Being able to work with someone as talented as Kyrie is not only a dream come true, but to have him be in a Celtics uniform while we're doing it — it's mind-blowing.”"

"For many sneaker and basketball fans, the natural answer to the question “"
"<a class=""text--link"" href=""https://news.nike.com/featured_video/air-jordan-11-the-grail"" target=""_blank"">What’s your grail?</a>"
What’s your grail?
”  is the Air Jordan XI Concord. The nuances of that answer lie in the strength of the shoe’s historical context and the longstanding power of its design.
"In 1995, MJ shocked the world when he announced his return from retirement with a simple message — “I’m Back.”"
"When he returned to the floor, he sported a #45 jersey, with #23 already hanging in the rafters. If that wasn’t enough to make fans scratch their heads, he also had something foreign on his feet. No one had seen anything like it. A white upper, while the rest of his team was wearing black? Check. A league fine for breaking uniform rules? Check. Patent leather on a basketball shoe? Check."
"But how? When the rest of the world was mourning His Airness’s departure from the court, legendary sneaker designer Tinker Hatfield remained in the kitchen cooking. He knew MJ had a love for the game that would lead him back to the hardwood. Sure enough, Jordan returned and Hatfield’s creation, the Air Jordan XI Concord, hit the court, changing the course of sneakers forever — again."
"Not only is MJ responsible for making Air Jordans part of basketball history on the court, he’s also credited with creating some of his signature line’s most iconic features. Dating back to the design of the AJ IX, MJ had been asking Hatfield and his design team to push the envelope and incorporate patent leather. His reasoning was twofold: First and foremost, the patent leather would help keep his forefoot locked-in on quick stops and cuts. MJ also predicted the patent leather would be a hit off the court, even going as far as saying people would wear them on red carpets and at other formal events. Hatfield, who admits to being initially skeptical of MJ’s suggestion, eventually bought into the idea and added it to the AJ XI. By the time people internally saw the design, they weren’t asking, “Why the shiny leather?”, they were asking why he was making another signature model for the retired MJ in the first place. He knew MJ well enough to know the AJ XI would get its time to shine."

"The history books will tell you MJ lost that year’s playoff series against Orlando, but they miss the most important part: MJ never lost, he learned. That series would fuel him in the off-season and inspire him to lead his team to a historic season and eventual second three-peat."
"By the time he took the floor for the following season, the word had spread. These were not just basketball shoes, they were the “Concords,” the ultimate grail. Every fan, diehard and casual, needed to have them. Whether at awards shows or on court, they made a statement wherever they appeared. Soon, it was out with the dress shoes and in with the Concords. Graduation? Lace them up. Wedding? “I do” to the XIs."
"Annually, the AJ XI is highly anticipated during the holidays. This year, the Air Jordan XI Concord gets passed to the next generation so it can change the game just like MJ did. Highlights include the original patent leather cut, Nike Air details on the insole, original box and the #45 on the heel — just like when they debuted on court."

"Nike’s first collaborative project with Fear of God founder and creative director Jerry Lorenzo is highlighted by an court-ready basketball shoe, the Nike Air Fear of God 1. During the last few weeks, glimpses of the design — which incorporates a double-height Zoom Air heel unit — came through a preview of Lorenzo’s latest Fear of God offering and then appeared on the feet of NBA stars. The rollout is tactical, all part of Lorenzo’s desire to focus on the emotional element of sport. "
Jerry Lorenzo's court-ready Nike Air Fear of God 1
Jerry Lorenzo's court-ready Nike Air Fear of God 1
"“It is a shoe that should only be judged by the emotion it gives the kid when he first sees it — however it makes him feel,” says the Los Angeles-based designer. “We live in a day and age when images are leaked left and right, and products are leaked without consideration and emotional attachments. I’m aiming to give a visceral experience whether the kid sees it first on Ben Simmons coming into the arena or worn by his favorite athletes on court.”"
Lorenzo wants to tap into a certain element of nostalgia. Not so much about 
<em>what</em>
what
" was worn, but "
<em>how</em>
how
" it was worn. He wants to awaken a spirit he deems dormant, to remind of the power sport once had in defining style. "
"“In my youth…growing up in the ’80s and finishing high school in the ’90s, contrary to what's happening now, it was our superstar athletes and our pro athletes that were informing the way that we wore our street clothes,” he says. “These athletes, like Agassi and Jordan, were at the top of their game and what they wore didn’t compromise on design or beauty.”"
The visible Nike Air window houses a game-changing double stack Zoom heel.
"Working with Leo Chang, Senior Footwear Design Director, Nike Basketball, on the Nike Air Fear of God footwear allowed Lorenzo to balance his aesthetic vision and performance aspiration. Says Lorenzo of Chang, “He’s someone with a phenomenal desire, who understands innovation and performance at a high level. He’s also patient and open to not only a new designer but a new design process.” This meant a lot of patience on both sides, Lorenzo says. “In order to create a product that doesn't compromise style or innovation, you can’t make concessions to process.”"
"Process is something Lorenzo says came from his athletic background in baseball and basketball. In sport, he found a foundation for how to go about life. The competitiveness that drove relative success on the field has been translated to his work as a designer."
"Recently, Lorenzo found that Nike’s 30th anniversary Just Do It campaigns affirmed the value of sport in all facets of life. Led by Colin Kaepernick, the lead spot, Dream Crazy, reminded Lorenzo that “there are people outside of sport who go about their lives through the spirit of sport.” "
And that is where he wants his collection to sit — within the soul of the wearer. 
"“This is for all the kids coming up in small cities with big-city dreams,” Lorenzo concludes. “It’s about what he feels he should have, not what he thinks he should have based on what society's telling him.”"

When Jordan Brand’s designers heard Union owner Chris Gibbs’s idea for a vintage-styled

Air Jordan footwear
" and apparel capsule, they were sold. They just had one question — what year?"
"“We’re referencing an era, late ’80s early ’90s,” explains Gibbs, an industry veteran who grew up during that era and understands that streetwear is at its best when it captures a vibe and is unencumbered by the strict technicalities of history."
"Gibbs frequents Los Angeles-area flea markets and vintage stores and is thus familiar with the Jordan touch points of his youth and how those have aged over time. “The Jordan stuff I wear now is like if I go to a vintage market and I find some really old stuff that’s kind of patinaed or weathered in,” he says. “To me, the vintage nature of it allows you to kind of wear it outside of its intended purpose.”"
"Taking Union’s reputation for elevated taste and commitment to quality fabrics and construction, the Union x Air Jordan collection carefully captures that transcendence. It pulls from a golden era in sports and streetwear — a tone evoked by the color of the wash on the apparel to the careful distressing on the "

.
"The shoes also capture Gibbs’s approach with a fresh perspective on the mashup. Each fuses together classic AJI colorways with a noticeable stitch mark, evidence of a process that celebrates DYI culture and vintage hunting. Gibbs describes the inspiration as finding your most coveted pair of sneakers at the flea market, then elevating it by combining it with another pair to create a unique 1-of-1."
"For the apparel, Gibbs leaned into his past experience to balance the right look and fit. “One of the things we worked on was the drape,” said Gibbs. “I’ve learned from buying and selling a lot of high fashion that once you get through your normal silhouette of a T-shirt and a jean — garments that everybody can kind of do — there is really a lot of attention placed on how garments fall on the body.”"

"The Nike Zoom Vomero +5 x A-COLD-WALL* is produced to discolor rapidly. ""It's about actually owning a product and working a product in,"" says A-COLD-WALL* designer, founder and creative director Samuel Ross. ""I find that there is quite a beauty in that."""
"How does an object change with use or over time? This question is the driving force behind Samuel Ross's work on the Nike x A–COLD–WALL* Capsule Collection, starring a radical reworking of the 2010 Nike "
"<a class=""text--link"" href=""https://store.nike.com/us/en_us/pw/zoom-vomero-running-shoes/8yzZntjZoi3"" target=""_blank"">Zoom Vomero</a>"
Zoom Vomero
" +5. ""I am interested in how a garment ages and in taking the user on that journey. That is something I believe should be encouraged. It's much more human. It's much more dynamic as well,"" says the London-born designer."
"The Nike x A–COLD–WALL* Capsule Collection reflects this philosophy in inventive fabrics, including a technical Japanese nylon that softens with warmth and heat, and the removal of PU coatings from the Nike Zoom Vomero +5 to accelerate the aging process (manifested by a yellowing)."
"The Nike x A–COLD–WALL* Parka allows for two dynamic fits. ""First is the classic overbearing overcoat with a dramatic silhouette. The other is toward an incredibly modern, and actually quite exposed and unresolved, cropped high jacket,"" says Ross."
"In this, the collection neatly follows Ross's first Nike project, a "
"<a class=""text--link"" href=""https://news.nike.com/news/nike-af1-a-cold-wall"" target=""_blank"">Nike AF1 High</a>"
Nike AF1 High
", which was designed to highlight the shoe’s individual components through subtle shifts in color from gray to white, reversed leathers and a disguised Swoosh (just its stitch was left). However, the employment of dynamic materials allows Ross's theory to mature as well. His ideas balance an active and static state — each piece in the collection is attractive as sculpture, but most enchanting when lived in."
"""With the Vomero, there has been this opportunity to really exalt the technology of its time and modernize the aesthetic, which is uncompromised to its purpose and function,"" says Ross. ""It's interesting to look at a shoe which has such a beautiful and polished wire frame, and then to be able to isolate individual aspects of that shoe, to really exalt the technology. It is very exciting to take something that is very beautiful and to not necessarily reinterpret but to reevaluate the product."" "
"As with the AF1, Ross draws the eye to specific components in the Vomero; by manipulating the lifespan of the colors he forces continual reaction to those elements as the materials shift with wear. This creates a subtlety that juxtaposes the architectonic form of the heel counter so that the smallest details reach a harmony with the more overt styling. "
"""With the garments that we produce with Nike, there is this element of sophistication weaved through the simplistic shapes, which have these small details,"" says Ross. ""Those details come down to the use of things, like Japanese nylon on the Parka, something that is initially coarse but with wear actually soften."""
"Ross describes the Nike x A–COLD–WALL* pant having ""a very stark and staunch and hostile feel."""
"Outerwear, in many ways, has been the driving force of A-COLD-WALL*. In producing coats and jackets, Ross has found opportunity to explore technical materials — like those used in this collection — and find a true communicative force for his brand ethos. With Nike, Ross also advances his approach to legwear. Take the Nike x A–COLD–WALL* pant. ""Cropping the pant and adding this tension around the back of the knee joint really gives it a very stark and staunch and hostile feel. This is the first time I have really tried to capture the energy of the outerwear in a trouser, and it pairs so well with the sneaker,"" he says."
"Within each portion of the collection, the story of an aging process is continued. The more one wears a piece in, truly lets it live, the more it changes. And with that, the Nike x A–COLD–WALL* Capsule Collection champions not just an exciting use of materials, but the raw energy and lifecycle of a product."
The Nike x A–COLD–WALL* Capsule Collection launches November 17 exclusively in London. A global release follows November 29.

"Nike Flyleather is good for more than replication too. It has properties — unique fiber characteristics, controllable modification and a less dense, uniform structure of leather-rich substrate — that create improved opportunities for laser and print embellishment and textural explorations through embossing and other machinations."
What does this do for future Nike icons? The gallery below offers a tease of the potential:

A painting by artist Aaron Elvis Jupin depicts the chaos and deconstruction mentaility that Brain Dead founders Kyle Ng and Ed Davis were striving for in their Converse collaboration.
The text on the Converse x Brain Dead Chuck 70 reads: “To see and be seen as far as the eye can see. Who Controls the Control Men. The same elsewhere.”
"Converse first applied a graphic pattern — a camouflage print — to the Chuck Taylor All Star in 1983. Glow-in-the-dark animal prints followed in 1988, a patriotic American Flag print in 1991 and since then innumerable motifs have graced sneaker culture's most recognizable silhouette."
"These archival prints form the starting point for the new collaborative project between Converse and Los Angeles-based creative collective Brain Dead. Led by founders Kyle Ng and Ed Davis, Brain Dead takes an unexpected, unique approach to retooling the iconic Chuck 70, and debuts subversive spins on archetypal garments like the MA-1. ""People always expect us to do graphic work,” says Ng. “We wanted to take a more conceptual approach with Converse. We were inspired by pattern deconstruction — we were interested in creating chaos with something that already existed.”"
"The Chuck 70 is the most apparent example of this, taking a variety of prints (animal, American flag, camo) and bringing them together. If the intent was to baffle the eye, the end result was a surprise — at least for the Brain Dead crew."
"""The weird thing is, because these are classic patterns, it works together in harmony,"" says Ng.  "
"What could have served as a point of tension became a point of distinction, and subsequently the backbone of the whole project, where preexisting icons are reworked with a dissident eye. This speaks to Brain Dead's creative spark, and the elasticity of the Converse brand's place in a variety of subcultures."
"""The Chuck is an icon. But the spirit of the brand is iconoclastic — that's important to the way we look at collaborations,"" says Brook Bergland, Converse Apparel Design Director. ""For example, with Brain Dead, we took the fleece hoodie and the MA-1 and we subverted both classics to create a hybrid that is unified by a PrimaLoft lining."""
"The garment, the Converse x Brain Dead Hooded Bomber Jacket, is a testament to the notion that disparate points of view create new and often very interesting ideas. Here, the sanctity of apparel standards is destroyed in favor of experimenting with ""what-if"" potential. "
"""The mash-up of the hoody and the jacket is part of the deconstruction mentality — we're dissembling things and putting them together to make something new,"" Ng explains."

"One feature in the new Patta collaboration with Nike: oversized, eye-catching font. Photo by Stephen Tayo."
"The bold typography on one element of Patta’s latest collaboration with Nike, a dark obsidian jacket, is reminiscent of the signage at Amsterdam’s Schiphol airport. The font is one of many sources mined for the collection, which is a study in interconnected and seemingly disparate references that make up the ""Publicity. Publicity. Wohooooow!"" collection."
"“Traveling. Visiting each other. Getting to know each other. For us, that is where the collaboration between Nike and Patta started,” explains Patta’s Vincent Van de Waal."
"“We wanted to make head-to-toe outerwear, but have it somehow feel like a tracksuit, so we adjusted existing Nike silhouettes to make it our own,” says Patta's Vincent Van de Waal. Photo by Stephen Tayo."
"The inside of the checkered jacket is quilted and fleece-lined, and features the collaboration's namesake: ""Publicity. Publicity. Wohooooow!"" Photo by Stephen Tayo."
"On the back of the dark obsidian jacket is a large white flag, which Van de Waal says is ""an invitation to project messages on, to color, to write on and to vandalize.” Photo by Stephen Tayo."
"The phrase, ""Publicity. Publicity. Wohooooow!,” stems from another sort of collaboration — the spontaneous “happenings” of 1960s avant garde artists, like Amsterdam’s Robert Jasper Grootveld. For the Patta crew, these engagements remind of a need not just for self-awareness and irony, but as Van de Waal notes, about how branded items become an act in space as well."
"Thus, a requisite boldness holds key position in the collection. Apparel was chosen as a way to mix technical elements with classics. “We wanted to make head-to-toe outerwear, but have it somehow feel like a tracksuit, so we adjusted existing Nike silhouettes to make it our own,” says Van de Waal."
"It's running sportswear, but not. Technical, but casual. Most important, it's an exercise in expressing and blending the performative elements of sport with those of style."
"Evidence of this thought comes through in the checkered suit, which is, in fact, an homage to a pioneering jazz musician"
<strong> </strong>
 
who asked following his final Paris concert not “How did I play?” but “How did I look?”
"While the reference there is overt, on the other suit — the dark obsidian with bold typography — the inspiration is open-ended. The back features a large white flag, which Van de Waal explains: “The white flag bearer is historically the one who seeks to negotiate. We associate the white flag with peace, seize fire and surrender: a positive symbol in an increasingly polarizing society and public space. The white flag is also an invitation to project messages on, to color, to write on and to vandalize.”"
"Fittingly, Patta broadens its collaboration with a more literal invitation, giving space to extended family to share their unique perspectives on the output as a series of campaigns that form “happenings” both physically and digitally. The work is collated in a book, created in collaboration with Linda van Deursen, featuring all 11 artists, including Bart Julius Peters, Dana Lixenberg, Oko Ebombo, Nigel Shafran, Qiu Yang, Joyce Ng, Morgan Knibbe, Vincent Van de Waal, Violette Esmeralda, Sam de Jong and Stephen Tayo. A short film by Morgan Knibbe can be viewed "

.
"The final flourish of the collaboration is the Air Max 90 x 95. “Both silhouettes are among our favorites,"" says Van de Waal. ""The Air Max 90 is a robust classic, and the 95 has always felt like a futuristic design; combining both forms a mix between classic and more technical design.”"
"By way of Nike by You, the mix is also available for further customization, broadening (again) the nature of the collaboration and inviting all participants an opportunity to give the shoe a personal spin."

" Kenny, which takes the Cortez’s classic lines and applies a simplicity and convenience of use from an Angelino staple: the house shoe."
"“House shoes have always been part of LA culture,” says Lamar. His intent with the Kenny IV was to retain the ease and comfort of the slipper, but also allow people to still feel sleek. “The shoe is all about being able to get up and just go out in style.”"
"In that vein, Lamar believes the shoe successfully attaches personal thought to classic, vintage style. What’s more, it synthesizes the values of Lamar’s home community in an unbounded way. Lamar notes that, in the shoe’s making, he was fascinated by all the possible color palettes and the many ways you can give a shoe character."
"This experience provided Lamar more insight on the process of designing and stoked his individual love for Nike anew. ""To actually sit in the room with people just as passionate as I am about creating, lets me know that Nike has always had a driven purpose,"" he says."
"Having touched digital commerce with a first-of-its-kind in arena SNKRS drop and pop-up experiences, Lamar's collaborative efforts with Nike extend well beyond the Cortez silhouette. This underscores his desire to connect with community — both physically and emotionally — by never forgetting the human element."
"""With ideas being open and honest, our possibility has no boundaries,"" Lamar says of his future with Nike."

Tom Sachs holds the Nike Mars Yard Overshoe.
"The initial need for the Nike Mars Yard Overshoe was simple: In late winter, one's feet get cold and wet. "
"“The Mars Yard Overshoe, its nickname is the March Yard — for March, the worst month of the year. It is wet, your feet are wet the whole month of March,” says Tom Sachs.   "
Simple. 
"But its story is more complex — one of trials and errors, questions and answers."
"Sachs learns by doing, more explicitly by making, most directly by testing. The artist, who came to fame as a sculptor and now works across a variety of media, embraces transparency in materials and the underpinnings of how things work. "
"His collaborative journey with Nike, under the moniker "
"<a class=""text--link"" href=""https://nikecraft.com"" target=""_blank"">NIKECraft</a>"
NIKECraft
", is no exception. “NIKECraft is an adjective,"" says Sachs. ""It means a combination of things only Nike can produce and things only Sachs can produce. It is fifty-fifty. It is an aesthetic of transparency."""
"A full, transparent breakdown of the Nike Mars Yard Overshoe"
If Sachs learns by doing (

his first Nike product arrived in 2012
", his experience in footwear expanding exponentially since then), he reveals areas of intrigue by questioning. This often happens by pushing the limits of an item's function. Sachs wants to know not just why something works, but how far it will work — always with unrelenting vigor. This can disrupt Nike design-thinking (Sachs is damn good at rallying a fresh perspective on solutions), but it also gives him cause to find fresh angles for himself. Again, NIKECraft is a fifty-fifty enterprise."
"“For me, the biggest challenge I’ve overcome stems from this: It is very easy to make things in the studio. We have a privilege, and an advantage, because we make things one at a time. We are like a 19th-century-style workshop. When you do things the Nike way, you engineer for the manufacturing process,"" he explains. ""As an artist, the greatest thing Nike has given me is the ability to expand my creative process and think ‘these are not constraints, these are other ways of thinking.’ It’s very valuable."" "
"For example, Sachs found that, through heavy daily use, the initial Mars Yard shoe didn’t meet his expectations. "
His work as an impromptu wear-tester (now more recognized and more standardized — the Sachs studio is actually the first true urban wear-test center in Nike history) led to the 
"<a class=""text--link"" href=""https://news.nike.com/news/tom-sachs-mars-yard-2-0"" target=""_blank"">Mars Yard 2.0</a>"
Mars Yard 2.0
 in 2017. This replaced the original Vectran®️ upper with a polyester warp-knit tricot mesh and inverted the tread of the outsole for more appropriate wear in urban environments.
"Sachs' latest Nike project, the Mars Yard Overshoe, is an extension of this process. It's all about working under the consideration of how the Mars Yard 2.0 performs when conditions sour. What could Sachs employ to transition his equipment? Answering for questions of weather appropriateness, it allowed frustrations (freakout-inducing cold, wet feet) to channel solutions (the employment of a Dyneema®️, a super-strong fiber often used in boat rope and sails). Experience also diversified function. While wearing the Overshoe all the way up fends off the elements, rolling it down makes inside, heated spaces tolerable. The duality serves well for the annoyances of a New York March, and allows chic navigation of street, subway and fashion week. A new tread pattern, created by a small siping at the highpoints of the outsole, is designed from a mastery of New York's winters too."
"As with all of Sachs' product, the Mars Yard Overshoe balances the raw honesty of the materials and manufacturing with the artist's touch. "
In celebration of the London premiere of Sachs’ latest film 
"<em>Paradox Bullets, </em>"
"Paradox Bullets, "
a limited release of the Nike Mars Yard Overshoe will be available October 11 at DSM London. (Product available in-store only via online raffle. Conditions apply. Please follow DSM for details). A global release date for the shoe will be announced in the coming months.

The first Women’s Jordan OG collaboration with LA-based designer Melody Ehsani is rooted in bringing basketball to a new generation.
"“The legacy [of the Women’s Air Jordan OG] speaks for itself,” says Ehsani. “It was an exciting time in history with the inception of the WNBA and all the incredible women who were coming into the game. The shoe is really an emblem of this moment, a first in many regards.”"
"Symbolizing women’s excellence on and off the court, the designer chose an updated approach to the Air Jordan OG SP x Melody Ehsani, and through a classic lens. The black and infrared shoe is highlighted by a cherry detailing — a symbol of abundance and closely associated with the goddess of fertility."

"If Undefeated's initial Nike Air Max 90 paid direct 1990s-homage, the second effort from the LA-based outfit delivers a sneaker design version of a retro futurist approach. "
"Rugged leather from edition one is replaced by myriad materials referencing the ’90s New York street scene's adoption of technical outdoor gear. In respect for the function-first origins of those practical pieces, the shoe itself is striped down and the silhouette's features deftly reinterpreted for 2020. "
"Approach to the design began first with  fabrication, trying to mix iconic sneaker fabrics, such as nubuck leather and hairy suede, with translucent materials and technical mesh to give a modern vibe to a classic silhouette."
"This approach lead to some restructuring of the shoe's paneling to both reduce material and streamline the upper pattern. The Swoosh is thus elongated and the typical rubber ""Air Max"" marker above the Air-unit window is removed. Padding in the tongue and heel is also minimized, adding to the sleeker form. Additional details include a heel pull tab and tongue lacing reminiscent of the Nike Vomero 5. "
"The colorways are a study in contrast — a concise, all-black look highlighting the depth and texture of the build, and a blue Undefeated exclusive, honoring past Nike ACG and Running footwear and apparel."
The Undefeated exclusive colorway was inspired by the colors and hues that came out of the golden era of running shoes — the late ’80s and early ’90s — and the pop colors of outdoor sneakers that were making noise from ’92 to ’95 in NYC.
"The black Undefeated Nike Air Max 90 launches March 14 at Undefeated stores, followed by a second release March 19 on SNKRS. The Undefeated exclusive blue colorway retails on Air Max Day, March 26. "

"Parisians also carry a unique affection for the brand. “In the United States, if you hear Jordan you probably think it’s a basketball or hip-hop event. No, in Paris right away ‘it’s Jordan’ — it’s not just for basketball players or the hip-hop community,” says Laurent Nicolas Bourgeois, one half of the acclaimed dance group, Les Twins, along with twin brother Larry Nicolas. “We are one of the biggest fans of Jordan in the world. We are super fans.”"

"Fittingly, the Jordan Brand x Paris Saint-Germain collection delivers holistic performance and lifestyle offerings, including two special edition match kits, footwear and apparel. The kits are built on a Nike Vaporknit Match chassis and feature clean black and white colorways with red accents that will be used as the club’s third and fourth kits. The goalkeeper kit comes in bold Infrared, a nod to one of Jordan Brand’s heritage colors. “We’re excited to unite these two passionate communities by putting the Jumpman on the chest of Paris Saint-Germain to continue fueling the energy for sport and style globally,” says Jordan."
"The footwear and apparel collection channels the predominately black-and-white look of the kits, but also adds a strategic use of red, another Jordan Brand heritage color and prominent color on Paris Saint-Germain kits. Additionally, each product features a unique remix of the two iconic logos, placing the Jumpman in the Paris Saint-Germain crest. "

Few shoes embody the toughness of late ’80s basketball design like Converse's ERX.
"Famously worn by several members of Detroit's rough-and-tumble, back-to-back title-winning team, the ERX also graced the feet of rock stars and skate legends. The wearers shared a hard-working, defiant spirit, and ERX became a beacon for the bold."
"First released in 1988, the ERX had an equal balance of bulk and tech. Underfoot, Converse's Energy Wave technology provided enhanced cushioning and spurred the Energy Return Multiplier (ERX) moniker. Thirty years later, the sneaker that epitomized the over-the-top basketball style of the late 1980s is born again, and with the help of streetwear designer Don C to reflect the bold attitude and style of basketball culture today."
CONVERSE X JUST DON ERX
<br/>
"
The shoe — and illustration — captures the hard-nose attitude players and teams had in the '80s, when basketball was a much rougher sport."
"""There is a new generation at the helm, and they are ushering in personal memories and testimonies; this enables a rediscovery and resurgence of past models with fresh perspective,"" says Jimmy Manley, Senior Director Special Projects, Converse. ""We were taking Don C through the archives and when we got to the ERX, before we could even get into presenting it he goes, 'I remember that shoe, this is "
<em>the</em>
the
" shoe!' It spiraled into this rally cry to bring it back."""
"The Chicago-born designer recalled the shoe's championship pedigree — it capped a decade in which Converse athletes defined title-winning. More than that, Don C was reminded of the cross-cultural adoption it enjoyed. ""I remembered the ERX model because it had so many layers in the past,” he says. “That makes me proud, because I love when basketball becomes part of another arena.”"
"Illustrator Benjamin Marra's interpretation of the Converse ERX 260 Animal, which evokes the power and energy of '80s footwear ads."
Skateboard graphics in Marra's rendering of the Converse ERX 260 reflect an era that merged basketball and skate.
"Reminiscent of early '90s metal-album artwork, this design alludes to the counter adoption of the ERX off the court."
"Bringing back the ERX gives the brand a unique opportunity to dig into its basketball history and carve out a future of creative rebellion as Converse reclaims its heritage in the sport. Says Manley, ""It allows us to have a different attitude, one that is authentic to Converse — a counterculture view to basketball and street style."""
The Converse x Just Don ERX Hi arrives in White/Vaporous Grey/White this holiday season. A range of collaborative Just Don apparel and accessories will complement the shoe.

"Tokyo native and seasoned Nike partner and collaborator Jun Takahashi has long been revered as one of fashion’s most influential designers; his eponymous clothing label UNDERCOVER has been a staple of cool-kid closets since he founded the brand in 1990. Takahashi first partnered with Nike in 2010, and since then the fashion icon has added his touch to several Nike staples, including his renowned Nike Running partnership, Gyakusou."
"For his latest collaboration, Takahashi brings his unique UNDERCOVER irreverence to the Nike React Element 87."
"Debuted on the UNDERCOVER runway at Paris Fashion Week Fall-Winter 2018, the Nike React Element 87 x UNDERCOVER takes inspiration from heritage running shoes like the Nike Internationalist, adds reflective and transparent details and places it all on Nike React foam.

Rather than choosing an earlier retro model, the duo decided on the Air Jordan XX, a silhouette they both agreed is underrated. “I think that it was a bit ahead of its time, but the shoe was always cool,” says Anthony. “This is a shoe I liked when I saw it, but it didn't get its fair moment. I wanted to bring it back, rework it and re-introduce it to the market.”"

"“The collaboration has led to a fusion of something that’s incredibly exciting — not just a shoe, but a message that’s inspiring to other women,” said Khatachourian."
"Noel, Celeste-Duncan and Goldson attend a design session at Nike World Headquarters, where they were mentored by Nike Basketball footwear designers Meline Khatachourian and Jason Petrie."
Kimberly Goldson says the designers and James felt a kinship the moment that he described his vision for the shoe.
"“We each had something that connected the four of us based on what LeBron saw from his mom, and the sacrifices she made for him,” says Goldson. “My mom did it. LeBron’s mom did the same for him. The connectivity was there between all of us.”"
"The HFR x LeBron 16 was unveiled at the Harlem's Fashion Row Showcase Gala on September 4, during which James was honored for his influence and contribution to the community. Although he’s watched many signature shoes evolve in his career, the sight of the HFR x LeBron 16 is deeply personal."
"“As someone who has a platform, because of what I do, I thought it was important to lend that platform to a group of people that I believe are under-recognized,” says James. ""Being the son, husband and father of strong African American women, I felt like this was something I wanted to do for them and for all the strong women out there who are succeeding despite what might be stacked against them.”"
"In its cooperative creation, the HFR x LeBron 16 is a symbol of unified strength. The shoe was always driven by a mission greater than its individual parts — one focused on assisting others."
"The HFR x LeBron 16 is inspired by James' belief that ""African-American women are some of the strongest people on earth."""

"Almost a decade before the founding of seminal hardcore band Suicidal Tendencies, frontman Mike Muir received his first pair of Converse as a birthday gift. "
"""I think I was 10, 11 or 12,"" he recalls, which puts his first wear in the mid-70s. He was immediately attracted to Chucks for the purity of the shoe's character. ""It's one of those things that sells itself. You could identify with the shoes where we were from in California."" "
"Far from being nostalgic, Muir views Converse's most enduring silhouette as perennially proper. ""A lot of people always talk about the good old days. My dad always said 'don't ever be like that,' because when you're talking about the old days, you are not in your time."" "
"Suicidal Tendencies, from its '83 debut record to its latest, ""STill Cyco Punk After All These Years"" (releasing September 7) has stayed in its time. Muir attributes this to clarity of purpose. More specifically, he notes that their longevity owes a lot to avoiding prevalent trends in favor of sticking to what they like. "
"""Why do some things last?"" he asks, rhetorically. ""When you get into the collective, you try to fit in, and when you are the individual you really don't care. And then people tend to follow. That's what has served us. We've done what we've liked rather than follow what others like. Going back to the early '80s, almost 40 years, there's been so many different trends. But if you get on that bus you get off your road and end up being lost."""
"Part of this philosophy stems from the establishment, early in the band's history, of a graphic identity that has become a pop culture standard. Envisioned by Ric Clayton, Venice-born artist and early member of No Mercy, the band's artwork, with its skulls and raw hand lettering, defined the group's singularity. "
"This artwork forms the basis for Suicidal Tendencies' new collaborative collection with Converse. While born in the '80s, there's a timelessness that extends from the consistency Muir and the rest of the band present. ""We are very fortunate because we like where we are at and what we're doing,"" says Muir. ""We don't have a bell bottom and shag carpet stage, whereas a lot of people did things they wish they didn't."""
"For Muir, the collaboration's highlight is the Chuck 70 HI, made with a vintage canvas upper adorned with an all-over digital print and Suicidal Tendencies leather patch. ""If someone had told me in my teens I'd have a shoe, I'd have said 'no way,'"" he says. ""This would totally blow away that 16-year-old kid. That's a great thing."" "
"The remaining portions of the collection — a Chuck 70 low and apparel featuring screen-printed artwork ranging from a woven poplin shirt to sweatshorts — all follow the band's long-standing aesthetic. After all, if it still works, why change it? "
The new Converse x Suicidal Tendencies collection releases September 7 on converse.com and at select retailers. 
"An early release, in Converse’s hometown of Boston, will take place during a pop-up at Bodega that extends from September 6 (11am to 8pm) to September 7 (11am to 8pm), and coincides with a Suicidal Tendencies show at the House of Blues in Boston."

The black Converse x Dr. Woo Chuck 70 reveals a Sunset Gold colorway over time.
"Brian Woo — better known as Dr. Woo, one of the most in-demand tattoo artists in the world — has a proud, individualistic personal style. He’s quick to mix high and low and wears favored items until they reach a perfect patina. In this, the Converse Chuck 70 is a favorite, so unsurprisingly the silhouette is the focus of the artist's second collaboration with Converse."
"Attempting to visually chart evolution, Woo has created a shoe that transforms through abrasion and friction. “The shoe is a culmination of all things that I love — vintage, the wearing in of your own clothes, how it keeps developing, transitioning, and how the Chuck, specifically, can stay in your life so long,” he says.  "
"Arriving in either black or white, the Chuck 70s reveal Sunset Gold and Green Absinthe colorways, respectively, over time. The outsoles are transparent and Woo's famed eye motif sits on the left toe box."

" in mind. Following the popularity of the “Legends of the Summer” PE collection in 2013, Timberlake was ready to take it up a notch and design a colorway that would bring his album to life on his feet."
"As soon as the heartfelt tribute to his wife “Higher Higher” was created, Timberlake was already thinking of how to combine the ideas “Higher” and “Air.” “When we had the idea to make a product for every song, we knew making an Air Jordan would have to be what we did for ‘Higher Higher,’” says Timberlake. The answer was an Air Jordan III, one of Timberlake’s all-time favorite sneakers."
HIGHER is engraved on the medial upper of each shoe.
"Beyond being a touching love letter to his wife, “Higher Higher” also includes a universal message that Timberlake wants everyone to understand: “It’s really about the idea that no matter what we have in life, our relationships are the most important thing. Money, fame, success are all fleeting, whereas a real relationship will last for the long haul.”"
The left and right insole feature lyrics “FAME IS A LIE” and “STRESS IS CRUEL” respectively.
"Another relationship Timberlake holds close is the one he has with Jordan Brand. This close bond is what led to a conversation with legendary designer Tinker Hatfield. While Timberlake had already started concepting how to bring the project to life, Tinker had something else up his sleeve: the original AJIII sketch. The first version of this meeting of the minds debuted in front of millions during Timberlake’s half time performance at the big game last February. The “Two Minute Warning” "

Justin Timberlake's visit to Nike World Campus to meet with Tinker Hatfield in January 2018.
"The “Air Higher” colorway delivers that by swapping out original materials to translate the theme of the album onto the iconic silhouette. “The album’s premise was really about making things in a handmade and artisanal way,"" says Timberlake. ""The same way the album is filled with live instrumentation, we wanted the shoe to have the same feeling of being premium and made by hand."""
 The AJ3 JTH trades traditional leather for a smooth suede and adds leather laces.
A 3M Swoosh is used as a nod to Timberlake’s stage presence under the bright lights.
A custom box features photography from the album’s photoshoot at his home in Tennessee.
The Air Jordan 3 JTH releases on August 28.

The shoe is designed for daily wear and is highlighted by an upper constructed with breathable mesh and augmented by lush suede overlays. The interior is seamless to prevent abrasion and ensure a smooth feel against the foot for all-day comfort. Additional padding to the collar and ergonomic tongue and heel loops further prioritize function-first design. "

"The Jordan Delta SP, a Sail/Photo Blue-White version of the shoe, launches April 4 on Jordan.com and at select retailers. The Vachetta Tan colorway arrives May 14 in full family sizing, and the Black colorway releases June 6."

"Originally released in 2002, the Nike Air Zoom Total 90 II was the perfect blend of comfort, power and precision. Made of soft KN-100 — a strong, light material — the boot’s namesake stemmed from the creation of a cleat that would support player comfort for the total 90 minutes of a match. The cleat featured asymmetrical, off-center lacing for a larger boot-to-ball surface (which helps create a cleaner strike), as well as Zoom Air units in the outsole for optimal traction and stud pressure reduction."
"The Nike Phantom VNM Future DNA T90 pays tribute to its predecessor’s classic black, white and red colorway, and translates the 2002 cleat’s goal of precision through modern Phantom VNM technology to facilitate a powerful strike. Most notably, the new boot comes equipped with a Precision Pwr strike zone in the instep — 13 ridges set at specific angles and ascending heights to help keep the ball down and to provide a bite on its surface. "

"If Undefeated's initial Nike Air Max 90 paid direct 1990s-homage, the second effort from the LA-based outfit delivers a sneaker design version of a retro futurist approach. "
"Rugged leather from edition one is replaced by myriad materials referencing the ’90s New York street scene's adoption of technical outdoor gear. In respect for the function-first origins of those practical pieces, the shoe itself is striped down and the silhouette's features deftly reinterpreted for 2020. "
"Approach to the design began first with  fabrication, trying to mix iconic sneaker fabrics, such as nubuck leather and hairy suede, with translucent materials and technical mesh to give a modern vibe to a classic silhouette."
"This approach lead to some restructuring of the shoe's paneling to both reduce material and streamline the upper pattern. The Swoosh is thus elongated and the typical rubber ""Air Max"" marker above the Air-unit window is removed. Padding in the tongue and heel is also minimized, adding to the sleeker form. Additional details include a heel pull tab and tongue lacing reminiscent of the Nike Vomero 5. "
"The colorways are a study in contrast — a concise, all-black look highlighting the depth and texture of the build, and a blue Undefeated exclusive, honoring past Nike ACG and Running footwear and apparel."
The Undefeated exclusive colorway was inspired by the colors and hues that came out of the golden era of running shoes — the late ’80s and early ’90s — and the pop colors of outdoor sneakers that were making noise from ’92 to ’95 in NYC.
"The black Undefeated Nike Air Max 90 launches March 14 at Undefeated stores, followed by a second release March 19 on SNKRS. The Undefeated exclusive blue colorway retails on Air Max Day, March 26. "

"Pagowski's design for the Chicago Bulls makes the mascot look ""strong and powerful,"" he says."
"“I thought that it would go together nicely, this Irish idea mixed in with the idea of good luck and fortune,” says Pagowski of why he added four-leaf clovers to his design on the Boston Celtics."
"Pagowski went “old school” with his Cleveland Cavaliers design. “I used the coat of arms, the swords and the ribbon to tie in with representing a novel cavalier, like in the 18th century or something,” he says."
"Pagowski based his Oklahoma City Thunder design on the intense look of the thunder. “I wanted to show the power and explosiveness of the natural phenomenon and use that energy to represent the team,” he says."
"To portray the powerful character of the Golden State Warriors, Pagowski based the team’s design on the bridge that connects Oakland with San Francisco. “It’s a beautiful, powerful structure,” he says."
"For the Houston Rockets design, Pagowski turned to the city’s connection to space. “The rocket is very powerful and explosive, and that brings the feeling of the energy and speed,” he says. "
"“The raptor is kind of like a dinosaur. So, I thought that two dinosaurs playing basketball seemed funny and kind of cartoonish,” says Pagowski of his take on the Toronto Rapots, one of his most playful designs."

"“This is a universal icon item that everybody should have. They’re part of my daily uniform. I will wear them until they fall apart!” Anderson says. The deliberate nuance and refined features of the Chuck ‘70 allowed for designs that are at once feminine and masculine. “I wanted to make sure the shoe felt modern, but underline its timeless features,” he says."
"“It’s another functionality than the Chuck, and it’s very easy to wear,” Anderson notes of the heritage running sneaker. The blocked body was the perfect place to playfully experiment with unique color combinations and proportions."
"“We wanted to work on a product that could still read as a low Chuck ’70, but work on the details. A vintage ballerina that inspired it was actually more of a sport slipper in mesh,” explains Anderson. “I liked the functionality and lightness of that shoe, and we decided to adopt some details to reinterpret the icon.”"

"The upper of the Air Max 97 Sk has iridescent, polyutherane-coated, copper/rose gold leather paired with black sandwich mesh and an HF weld of the Swoosh logo (instead of an embroidered Swoosh). It draws inspiration from the colors of the 1999 Air Tuned Max, including the yellow air unit."

The Air Max 97 Sk has Nike Ultra tooling that reduces the original shoe's weight and highlights its signature lines in a single-layer upper. It also introduces new Air-Sole PSI levels and softer foam density in the midsole.
The print on the insole is inspired by Moroccan patterns and incorporates the Swoosh logo. The all-new SK logo pays homage to the Air Max TN logo and is in the shape of a UK electrical outlet.
The braided embroidery along the tongue and heel references the embellished sportswear Skepta saw locals wearing during trips to Morocco.

"Abloh’s work on the Nike Air VaporMax, within the “REVEALING” set, presented an exciting challenge, because, at the time, the shoe hadn’t been released yet. Two more unreleased silhouettes, the Nike Zoom Fly SP and Nike React Hyperdunk 2017, were similarly stimulating in their newness and potential. Abloh was inspired by the cutting-edge cushioning innovations of Breaking2’s Nike Zoom Vaporfly Elite "

" and basketball’s React Hyperdunk 2017, and decided to introduce an evolution of the reveal called “GHOSTING” using translucent uppers. With these five shoes, including basketball icons that preceded the Hyperdunk (the Converse Chuck Taylor and Nike Air Force 1 Low), and a running icon that preceded the Vaporfly Elite (the Nike Air Max 97), Abloh says he wanted to use a common, semi-revealing material to unite their combined 94-year history."
"“My high school years were made up of playing soccer, skateboarding and biking year-round,” says Abloh. “What I've learned from playing sports and also being obsessed with design is that there is an inherent style and focus that exists amongst athletes and designers alike: What propels them to be the best comes from deep within.”"

"The former innovation allows additional Air to be integrated into the unit while the latter allows for more extreme Air geometries that enable designers to place even more Air directly underfoot. Together, these capabilities wholly eliminate the need for a traditional foam midsole."
"By shedding the weight and bulk of a foam layer, the new midsole achieves greater flexibility and spring without compromising structure, while also reducing weight and waste. And by placing the upper directly on the VaporMax Air unit, a pillowy sensation and greater energy response are produced."
